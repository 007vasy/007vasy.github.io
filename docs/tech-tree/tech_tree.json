            "desc": "The agricultural sector is not only responsible for feeding the world\u2019s population, but also comprises an important source of income and a major component of the global economy. Estimates suggest that over a billion people work in agriculture around the world, with approximately one-third of the economically active population deriving their livelihoods through farming or related activities.\n\nAgricultural techniques in leading economies are less labour-intensive and make greater use of mechanisation, bioscience and digital technology, with the sector contributing to national prosperity, jobs, innovation, exports, food security and safety, and environmental management. In 2019, agriculture provided around 1.45% of jobs in the UK, but the agri-food sector accounted for a Gross Value Added (GVA) of \u00a3120bn, or 6.3% of national GVA, as well as exports of \u00a323.6bn.\n\nSpace-based products and services are already beginning to have a significant and growing effect on the agricultural sector. Out to 2050, the impact of space on agriculture is expected to increase substantially, both in terms of breadth and depth. This includes new developments in space-based food production, hydroponics and closed-loop ecosystems, as well as the use of space-based products and services such as Earth Observation (EO), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and Precision, Navigation and Timing (PNT) in the terrestrial agriculture sector. For example, space may enable innovations in precision agriculture and the use of remote monitoring, yield and risk modelling, and autonomous and robotic systems to increase agricultural productivity in a range of environments. Future uses of space for space-based as well as terrestrial agriculture could therefore also have extensive knock-on benefits for environmental sustainability and the growth of the net-zero economy.\n\nFurthermore, they could enable future space-based habitats and long-duration space exploration missions through in-situ production of food and other supplies, as well as one day supporting colonisation and terraforming efforts on Mars or other celestial bodies. While space-based markets may face greater technical and financial barriers given the difficulties and costs associated with production of food in conditions of microgravity and limited space (e.g. on spacecraft or lunar/Martian habitats), the use of space to support terrestrial agriculture may be hindered more by varying levels of awareness among end users concerning costs and benefits of applying novel space-based applications [Globalagriculture.com, 2020; UK Government, 2020].",

As governments, industry and civil society seek to identify novel ways to support climate and environmental protection, space-based technologies may have several applications offering a mix of both incremental as well as potentially ground-breaking impacts.\n\nTaken to an extreme, growing exploitation of space out to 2050 may provide an \u2018insurance policy\u2019 to sustain humanity as a species if ecological collapse, climate disaster or some other event (e.g. use of weapons of mass destruction) were ever to render the Earth uninhabitable in future.",

In an electron bombardment thruster, a gas propellant enters a discharge chamber at a controlled rate. A hot, hollow cathode (negative electrode) at the center of the chamber emits electrons, which are attracted to a cylindrical anode (positive electrode) around the walls of the chamber. Some of the electrons collide with and ionize atoms of the propellant, creating positively-charged ions. These ions are then drawn toward a high-voltage electric field set up between two closely-spaced grids at the downstream end of the chamber.\n\nReference: [Electron Bombardment Thruster by David Darling](https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/electronbomthruster.html)",

The object of this proposal is to conduct a feasibility study for a novel, fusion-powered, space propulsion architecture that can ultimately change drastically the potential for human and robotic space exploration. The proposed design is based on neutron-free nuclear fusion as the primary energy source. An innovative beam conditioning/nozzle concept enables useful propulsive thrust directly from the fusion products, while some fraction of the energy is extracted via direct conversion into electricity for use in the reactor and spacecraft systems. This study focuses on providing the framework required to make fusion propulsion an appealing proposition for long-range space travel (by integrating the power generation and propulsion systems) rather than on the development of a specific fusion reactor concept. However, the scope of this study is not constrained by the immediate availability of fusion energy since it also analyzes \"hybrid\" schemes with a solar or fission primary energy source along with a sub-critical fusion reactor used as a plasma space propulsion system.\n\nReference: [Aneutronic Fusion Spacecraft Architecture](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/4373)",

The proposed effort is to take full advantage of these remarkable characteristics to develop an efficient bimodal ion-chemical thruster system using a common propellant supply tank. This proposal responds directly to the Dual Mode Propulsion focus area in the T2.03 STTR topic.  The expected mass and volume savings, increased propellant use efficiency and the added flexibility in thrusting options (high thrust with moderate Isp and lower thrust with high Isp) will significantly augment the operational propulsion and attitude control ranges, especially in small spacecraft applications. Phase I demonstrated and tested an efficient propellant management system interfacing the high pressure monopropellant tank with the ion electrospray thruster arrays. This allows the development in Phase II of a complete protoflight system, including multiple thruster arrays and control electronics, that can be integrated into a space mission. The Phase II development will leverage the existing ion electrospray thruster technology, and integrate it with the new propellant management system to provide a multi-thruster ion propulsion system. The assembly will be designed to interface with an existing compact chemical thruster to achieve a complete proto-flight bi-modal propulsion system, ready for integration and flight testing on a space platform.\n\nReference: [Bimodal Ion-Chemical Thruster System](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/113121)",

The resulting deflagration expands against a magnetic nozzle to produce thrust and generate recharge energy for the next pulse. A z-Pinch is a device that is commonly used to compress laboratory plasmas to high pressures (~1 Mbar) for very short timescales (~100 ns). An electrical discharge produces a high axial current along the outer surface of a column of plasma; this current in turn generates a very strong toroidal magnetic field. This self-generated magnetic field interacts with the axial current via the Lorentz force and radially compresses the plasma column, bringing it to very high densities and temperatures. This team is exploring a modified Z-pinch geometry as a propulsion system by encasing the fission- fusion target in a sheath of liquid lithium, providing a current return path. Numerical esults have been promising, the level of compression is sufficient to reach fission criticality. The fission energy boosts the fusion reaction rate, generating more neutrons which boost the fission process. This concept will potentially reach specific impulses of 30,000 sec with thrust levels sufficient to travel to Mars in a month and to interstellar space in a few decades.\n\nReference: [_Pulsed Fission-Fusion (PuFF) Propulsion Concept_ by Robert Adams (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2018_Phase_I_Phase_II/PulsedFission-Fusion_Propulsion_Concept/)",

The effect of channel size on reaction performance was investigated by comparing two reactors with different channel sizes in dry reforming of methane. In addition, the microstructure of the reactors can be further tuned via sintering temperature to achieve high catalytic performance owing to the balanced active surface and mass transfer.

Thus, submillimeter-wave antennae use 0.1-10 THz bands. Utilization of such frequency bands for the design of data transmission and sensing systems has a number of advantages:\n\n1. The very large bandwidth resolves the spectrum crowding problem and permits communication at very high data rates.\n\n2. The short wavelength allows the design of antennas of high directivity but reasonable size, so that high-resolution radar and radiometric systems and very compact guidance systems become feasible.\n\n3. Millimeter waves can travel through fog, snow, and dust much more readily than infrared or optical waves.\n\n4. Finally, millimeter-wave transmitters and receivers lend themselves to integrated and, eventually, monolithic design approaches, resulting in RF heads which are rugged, compact, and inexpensive.\n\nReference: [F.

The first step is KaBOOM.\n\nNASA is pursuing a demonstration of coherent uplink arraying at 7.145-7.190 GHz (X-band) and 30-31 GHz (Ka-band) using three 12m diameter commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) antennas separated by 60m at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  In addition, the Agency has demonstrated uplink arraying using up to three 34m antennas separated by ~250m at the Goldstone Deep Space Communication Complex in California and at X-band 7.1 GHz incorporating real-time correction for tropospheric phase fluctuations.  Such a successful demonstration would then enable NASA to design and establish a high power, high resolution, 24/7 availability radar system for\n1. tracking and characterizing observations of Near Earth Objects,\n2. tracking, characterizing and determining the statistics of small-scale (\u226410cm) orbital debris,\n3. incorporating the capability into the Agency's space communication and navigation tracking stations for emergency spacecraft commanding in the Ka-band era that NASA is entering, and\n4. fielding capabilities of interest to other US government agencies.\nThe Ka-band radar offers the possibility of high range resolution (5 cm) and high spatial resolution, also 5 cm for orbital debris in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) around the Earth (about 22,000 miles above the surface).  The project will consist of three phases or evolutionary steps that will lead to the new revolutionary capability.  The beginning is KaBOOM.\n\nNASA's KaBOOM is a space communication system at 8 and 30 GHz, currently in development at Kennedy Space Center, as the prelude to a high-power radar array.

Different classes of formation flying missions are currently under discussion within the engineering and science community: technology demonstration missions, synthetic aperture interferometers and gravimeters for Earth observation, multi-spacecraft interferometers in the infrared and visible wavelength regions as a key to new astrophysics discoveries and to the direct search for terrestrial exoplanets.

In fact, until today it has not been performed without humans in the loop. Autonomy is necessary in particular in the final phases of the approach of the chaser vehicle (chaser) to the target vehicle (target), due to the limited reaction time available to address anomalies and/or communication problems that might occur. A number of missions have been performed in the past with the objective of autonomously approaching and docking with a fairly controlled target. However, almost all of them suffered an onboard anomaly that in some cases completely compromised the mission, proving that, at present, the technologies necessary for autonomous proximity operations and capture even of a fairly controlled target lack in maturity.

Preliminary studies of the logistics of gathering material from the Moon and selected Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) have demonstrated very large enhancements of mass-retrieval capabilities using propellants derived from sources in space rather than propellants launched from Earth and carried throughout the mission. They also have clearly shown the enormous advantages inherent in deriving propellants from NEAs. This study examines water-based propulsion using NEA volatiles to manufacture storable chemical propellants. The problem of storable propellants on Earth has been solved by the use of hydrazine derivatives as fuel and N2O4 as oxidizer, both made possible by Earth's nitrogen-rich atmosphere. Nitrogen is scarce on asteroids, and would be best devoted to creating fire-retardant atmospheres for crews. There are plausible paths known for making asteroid-derived carbon-based storable fuels, but the provenance of a suitable storable oxidizing agent that does not employ nitrogen is an unsolved and difficult problem.\n\nReference: [In-Space Manufacture of Storable Propellants](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/91659)",

However, these facilities invariably require considerable water, add complexity to the Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) water recovery system due to the presence and challenge of handling soaps, and require considerable design complexity for microgravity operation. Here we propose an entirely new approach.

The first objective is to physically model the processes and material properties needed for the design of a system using concentrated sunlight to 3D print regolith in a simulated extraplanetary environment. Industrial 3D printing is often accomplished on Earth by sintering powder particles together using a laser. Many classes of materials have been successfully sintered including plastics, metals, and ceramics. Collected sunlight uses the same fundamental process of applying high energy to a small area of particles, sintering them together, scanning across a surface to make a sintered particle layer, and repeating the process by layers until a part is complete. Physical models of these processes have been produced in academia and industry for laser systems with regulated grain sizes and surface conditions, but there is no model for such a system using sunlight or unsieved regolith. The modeling will entail the use of optical design software such as Zemax for ray tracing and thermo-mechanical modeling in software such as ABAQUS. \n\nReference: [Concentrated Solar Regolith Additive Manufacturing\nCompleted Technology Project\n](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/95608)",

This rover resembles a squid, with tentacle- like structures that serve both as electrodynamic tethers to harvest power from locally changing magnetic fields and as a means of bio-inspired propulsion. The electrical energy scavenged from the environment powers all rover subsystems, including one that electrolyzes H20. Electrolysis produces a mixture of H2 and O2 gas, which is stored internally in the body and limbs of this rover. Igniting this gas expands these internal chambers, causing shape change to propel the rover through fluid or perhaps along the surface of a planetary body. The Phase I effort constitutes advancement of this revolutionary rover concept from TRL 1 to TRL 2. The work will be conducted at Cornell University, led by PI Mason Peck and Co-I Robert Shepherd. If the concept eventually succeeds, it will enable amphibious exploration of gas-giant moons, notably Europa. It likely is relevant to other moons of Jupiter and Saturn with liquid lakes or oceans. Juno's success notwithstanding, solar power near Jupiter is very limited. Furthermore, the recent cancellation of SMD's ASRG technology motivates alternatives to nuclear power. The bio-inspired technologies we propose to consider bypass the need to power rovers with limited-lifetime batteries, large solar arrays, or nuclear power. In this one respect, it is a breakthrough concept. Beyond addressing issues of power, this rover concept also bypasses the difficulties of typical mechanisms in fluid through uniquely suited soft robotics. The expanding-gas locomotion concept is both exotic and eminently realizable, grounded in experimental work by our team.\n\nIf the concept eventually succeeds, it will enable amphibious exploration of gas-giant moons, notably Europa.

The moons of Jupiter have transformed from Galilean sketches into entire worlds that we can observe and physically understand, giving great insight into our own planet and the formation of the solar system. However, despite all the observations we have collected, there are still far more secrets to uncover. Measurements of the outer planetary environments are much more difficult to obtain due to the expense of sending a spacecraft to investigate and, as such, we have a very limited capability to resolve phenomena spatially and temporally. Using this technique with small spacecraft like CubeSats rather than large, monolithic spacecraft in the outer planets would greatly enhance understanding of their environments, while decreasing mission costs. Compounding the lack of data are the harsh environments surrounding the outer planets. Even in Earth's orbit, dangers from solar and cosmic radiation, space plasmas, space debris, and meteoroids have contributed to numerous mission failures over the years. These hazards, though destructive, present an omnipresent energy source in the space environment. Rather than succumbing to this danger, an opportunity exists to harness these resources.

The resulting dependences of the output voltage and current as well as the spectral response of the InAs TPV have been extensively characterized for waste heat recovery applications.

That\u2019s because solar energy isn\u2019t being produced at night, or during a dense dust storm.\n\n\u201cThe first human bases on Mars could carry a 100 kilowatt nuclear reactor,\u201d said Zubrin. \u201cBut to have a Mars settlement, you're going to want 10 megawatts and for that kind of power, you need to develop Mars' geothermal potential.\u201d\n\nReference: [_How should we power a mission on Mars?_ by Amalyah Hart](https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/astronomy/power-mission-mars/)",

            "desc": "For many years NASA has used the decay of Pu-238 (in the form of the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS)) as a heat source for Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG), which have provided electrical power for many NASA missions. While RTG's have an impressive reliability record for the missions in which they have been used, their relatively low thermal to electric conversion efficiency (-5% efficiency) and the scarcity of Plutoinium-238 (Pu-238) has led NASA to consider other power conversion technologies. NASA is considering returning both robotic and human missions to the lunar surface and, because of the long lunar nights (14 earth days) isotope power systems are an attractive candidate to generate electrical power. NASA is currently developing the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) as a candidate higher efficiency power system that produces greater than 160 watts with 2 GPHS modules at the beginning of life (BOL) (-30% efficiency). The ASRG uses the same Pu-238 GPHS modules, which are used in RTG, but by coupling them to a Stirling convertor provides a 4-fold reduction in the number of GPHS modules. This study considers the use of Americium 241 (Am-241) as a substitute for the Pu-238 in Stirling convertor based Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) for power levels from 1 O's of watts to 5 kWe. The Am-241 is used as a replacement for the Pu-238 in GPHS modules. Depending on power level, different Stirling heat input and removal systems are modeled. It was found that substituting Am-241 GPHS modules into the ASRG reduces power output by about 1/5 while maintaining approximately the same system mass. In order to obtain the nominal 160 watts electrical output of the Pu-238 ASRG requires 10 Am-241 GPHS modules. Higher power systems require changing from conductive coupling heat input and removal from the Stirling convertor to either pumped loops or heat pipes. Liquid metal pumped loops are considered as the primary heat transportation on the hot end and water pumped loop/heat pipe radiator is considered for the heat rejection side for power levels above 1 kWe.\n\nReference: [Lunar Surface Stirling Power Systems Using Am-241](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20120016787)",

That means that a huge number of solar panels will have to be carried to the orbit in the outer atmosphere.  This is a significant technical challenge requiring a huge financial commitment.",

The modular generators could be inkjet printed on flexible substrates, including fabric, and manufactured using inexpensive roll-to-roll techniques.\n\n\u201cThe attraction of thermoelectric generators is that there is heat all around us,\u201d said Akanksha Menon, a Ph.D. student in the Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \u201cIf we can harness a little bit of that heat and turn it into electricity inexpensively, there is great value.

This type of system is ideal for planetary surface exploration due to the scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant nature of multi-agent systems and the low-mass, low-cost nature of small-scale robots. Unlike traditional sensor networks, robotic sensor networks have the advantage of being physically reconfigurable. Current state-of-the-art technology for motion control in robotic sensor networks has the objective of maintaining specific formations or maximizing coverage. But for space exploration, where a network may be deployed to scout harsh environments and deliver time-sensitive information back to a rover or base station, using controlled mobility to the advantage of data routing is an unexplored and promising research direction. The goal of this research is to investigate a motion control algorithm for robotic sensor networks which (1) distributes decision-making across robots, reducing dependency on the rover or base station and allowing scalability, flexibility, and fault-tolerance; (2) allows for the timely delivery of information to the rover or base station through the creation of an optimal multi-hop communication link; and (3) minimizes energy spent on communication and motion to be suitable for low-power, small-scale robots. By demonstrating the feasibility of this algorithm and evaluating its performance relative to a centralized communication architecture, this research will result in novel distributed autonomy for robotic sensor networks.\n\nReference: [Distributed Motion Control to Minimize Age of Information in Robotic Sensor Networks](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/96218)",

For example, the Mars Science Laboratory rover is operated by teams of people that re-plan the rover actions each Martian sol. As robotic explorers are sent further into the Solar System, limited bandwidth, communication delay, and the number of active missions make human-centered planning increasingly impractical and, in some cases, infeasible. A rover exploring the subsurface oceans of Europa will likely have low bandwidth overall with periods of communication blackout, and a short operational life to accomplish its mission. Therefore, it is imperative to employ robot autonomy systemically to improve productivity in all aspects of the life of a mission. Autonomy on a system-wide scale that reflects how human scientists behave in the field would significantly increase the scientific information gained from a mission. Human scientists continually reinterpret their measurements and assumptions with a growing contextual knowledge of the environment. They use each new piece of data to inform the next action while cognizant of operational constraints such as time, energy, and risk. State-of-the-art autonomous exploration methods expect a consistent objective and do not update the plan with each new measurement and changing priorities. The idea of systemic autonomy is extending beyond instrument-level autonomous functions to system-level autonomy, which enables the robot to reason about the environment, interpret science goals and hypotheses, determine utilization of all its instruments, monitor health and resources, and recover from faults.\n\nThe NASA Technology Roadmap expresses the need for better onboard robot autonomy. This was also endorsed at the 2018 Workshop on Autonomy for Future NASA Science Missions. This research addresses the Robotics and Autonomous Systems high priority topic of on-board planning and scheduling while managing resources. Automatically analyzing scientific measurements to inform sampling decisions and path trajectory is relevant to the topic of autonomous decision making.\n\nReference: [M.

As the distance to other planets introduces a significant communication delay, the efficient operation of a robot system requires a high level of autonomy.\n\nPlanetary explorations have been one of mankind's greatest fascinations as it can potentially lead to the discovery of extraterrestrial life and greatly enhance our understanding of the universe. In this ongoing quest to learn more about regions beyond Earth, recent space exploration missions have deployed robotic rovers and a helicopter to survey our neighboring planets and moons. The landing of Mars rover \u201cPerseverance\u201d and the first controlled flight by \u201cIngenuity\u201d on Mars reaffirm the importance of robotic technology for planetary explorations. While sending robots to Mars signifies a critical advancement for planetary explorations, the deployed rigid robots may have limited dexterity and robustness. For example, the rovers are prone to sinking and entrapment because their wheeled locomotion is inefficient for crossing regolith common to Mars and moons. The rigid bodies of the rovers and helicopter also render them less resilient against collisions, and hence they have to actively avoid geometric hazards on other planets. To better navigate in these unfamiliar environments, it is therefore highly desirable if the exploratory robots can perform modes of locomotion that are far more dexterous and they can also be made more robust.\n\nReference: [C.

In recent years, LECS has been considered as a standard treatment for gastric GISTs in Japan. However, there are also several limitations in the LECS procedure. For instance, the full-thickness incisions caused by LECS may lead to contamination of the abdominal cavity during the operation and thereby increasing the risk of postoperative intra-abdominal infections or GI leakage.\n\nIn recent years, there were increasing studies about the application of robotic surgery in gastric cancer, and the clinical advantages of robotic gastrectomy had been initially confirmed.

An instrument such as the human hand is a perfect example; it is an organ for the reception of and reaction to tactile stimuli, a perception that guides the repertoire of manual functions. However, the integration of an analogous sensing suite into a robotic platform poses a major technological challenge. The \"smart skin\" solution IFOS proposes is 2-D sensor based on the integration of high-sensitivity embedded Fiber Bragg grating (FBG), a custom engineered composite material - Nano Particle Material (NPM) ? and data interpretation and on-board decision-making. This sensor will support multi-point strain sensing to control the force exerted by robot end-effectors or manipulators on an object, required by such operations as assembly, surface-machining and cutting. Our goal is design and control of an anthropomorphic manipulation prototype based on high-resolution artificial taction. Optical sensors promise particular advantages for a robot that can achieve high-fidelity force control and that can operate safely in contact with astronauts. FBG sensors are robust, highly accurate, and immune to electromagnetic interference. A network of such sensors can be integrated directly into the structure or skin of an anthropomorphic robot.",

            "desc": "The vast majority of precision cleaning at Kennedy Space Center utilizes either aqueous or solvent-based processes. While effective, these methods require expensive solvents, produce large waste streams, and have historically led to environmental contamination. Recently, researchers at KSC have demonstrated low pressure, capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) cleaning to be a viable cleaning option that does not use solvents. In this standard system, two electrodes are located outside of the reaction chamber one of which is connected to a radio-frequency power supply while the other is grounded. An electric field is generated between the electrodes that cause electrons in the process gas to separate from their nuclei, thereby producing plasma. However, in its current state, plasma-based precision cleaning suffers from two major drawbacks. First, because it is a low pressure process, the parts to be cleaned must fit within the vacuum chamber and second, cleaning efficiency decreases as the distance the plasma must diffuse into the part increases.\\nThis project will address these limitations by incorporating plasma cleaning onto a robot so that the inside of pipes, tanks, and other complex surfaces can be cleaned. This project will address challenges related to the robotic control of an atmospheric cold plasma jet inside a pipe. The robotic delivery vehicle will need to include a compliant mobility system, provide precision plasma jet positioning, and monitor and map its progress within the pipe. In future stages, technology development will include miniaturizing plasma and robotic components, adding cleanliness verification and other inspection tools.\n\nReference: [Precision Cleaning Robot](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/95564)",

The passive compliance that exists within tensegrity structures will allow the joints to enjoy the benefits associated with soft robots, namely the ability to function well in uncertain environments and operate safely alongside humans.

This research will enable active elastic skins, where a 2D skin may be wrapped around any highly deformable 3D object to create a highly functional soft robot. Using this approach, any deformable material may be the foundation of a soft robot, such as an inflatable balloon or block of foam.

            "desc": "Harvest Moon Automation is developing a two phase gripper that is extremely compliant and flexible when it engages an object and then becomes rigid allowing it to pull or rotate the object. When it engages the object the gripper forms itself to the object and gently pushes away other obstructions such as wires and tubes. After it engages the object, it enters the second phase, whereby it becomes rigid. This allows the gripper to pull or rotate the object. NASA will depend upon intravehicular activity robots (IVA) robots such as the NASA Astrobee and Robonaut 2 to perform payload operations and spacecraft caretaking on Gateway, the orbiting facility that will be positioned near the moon. Fine grasping tasks such as plugging and unplugging electrical and fluid connectors will be difficult for current state of the art grippers. The connectors will be nestled among other connectors, wires and tubes. The HMA adaptive robotic gripper has narrow and flexible fingers that allow it to be easily maneuvered around obstacles to the connector. After grabbing the connector the fingers will stiffen so that they have a rigid hold on the connector. The two phase gripper can be easily maneuvered to the connector in its flexible phase and then wrap around the connector and become rigid in its second phase allowing the robot to rotate and push/pull the connector into position. The unique advantages of the HMA adaptive gripper is that it is a simple design that is easy to position and activate. Unlike a precision gripper with rigid fingers that move through a defined profile, the adaptive gripper has very flexible fingers that do not move through a defined profile. When actuated the flexible fingers conform to the profile of the object that it is gripping. Precise positioning of the adaptive gripper relative to the connector is not required. The adaptive gripper has the dual advantages of having flexible fingers that become very rigid when grabbing and moving the object.",

The TIRS instrument contains 640x512 longwave infrared quantum well infrared photodetector focal plane arrays (LWIR QWIP FPAs) jointly developed by NASA/GSFC and QmagiQ. We propose to achieve the higher pixel resolution while simultaneously improving quantum efficiency and operating temperature by using antimony-based strained layer superlattice (SLS) detectors. A key challenge is dealing with the effects of reducing pixel pitch from 25 microns down to ~ 10 microns, viz. optical fill-factor, optical crosstalk, processing difficulties, pixel operability, etc. As a stepping stone in Phase I, it is proposed to develop and deliver SLS FPAs with 1280x1024 format on 12 micron pitch that will address these challenges and quantify the effectiveness of our solutions. In Phase II, it will increase FPA format to 2048x2048 and push cutoff wavelength to the longest possible value while still hitting desired quantum efficiency and operating temperature targets in consultation with NASA/GSFC.

Additionally, radiometric calibration provides the means to compare image sets acquired by multiple sensors at different times and geometries. \n\nSensor radiometric calibration and stability is typically accomplished by initially calibrating an imaging sensor in a laboratory before it is fielded or integrated onto a spacecraft and launched. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable integrating sphere based radiometric calibration sources have been the laboratory work horse technology for several decades.  However, with a few exceptions, many calibration systems are from vendors that sell designs and technology similar to those that were introduced into the market a decade or more ago even though advances in digital imagers and spectroscopic systems would benefit from several improvements.  In addition, the push for higher spatial resolution imagery is causing scaling issues with traditional designs.\n\nA systems engineering approach was used to develop an advanced calibration source for imaging systems.  To accomplish this, a novel large integrating sphere, made from a fiberglass shell instead of a traditional aluminum shell, along with electronically adjustable high power LED light sources capable of producing a computer controlled uniform light source, was developed.  The resulting LED illuminated integrating sphere can be used to calibrate large optical systems over a large range of radiance levels. \n\n\nReference: [Advanced Calibration Source for Planetary and Earth Observing Imaging](https://techport.nasa.gov/view/16865)",

Soil fertilized by the compost keeps nutrient ions in forms easily accessible for uptake by plant roots. Nitrogen in organic compounds is converted to ammonium ion through hyper-thermophilic aerobic fermentation. The oxidative process producing nitrate ion does not take place during composting because Nitrosomonas or Nitrobactor cannot survive or be active under temperatures higher than 80 \u00b0C. For the same reason, the denitrification process might not be activated. Organic nitrogen, typically amino or heterocyclic group in bio-chemicals, is either converted to ammonium or remains in an undigested form in the compost, thus reducing any losses of nitrogen.\n\nReference: [S.

            "desc": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanically_interlocked_molecular_architectures\n\nMechanically interlocked molecular architectures (MIMAs) are molecules that are connected as a consequence of their topology. This connection of molecules is analogous to keys on a keychain loop. The keys are not directly connected to the keychain loop but they cannot be separated without breaking the loop. On the molecular level the interlocked molecules cannot be separated without the breaking of the covalent bonds that comprise the conjoined molecules, this is referred to as a mechanical bond. Examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures include catenanes, rotaxanes, molecular knots, and molecular Borromean rings. Work in this area was recognized with the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Bernard L. Feringa, Jean-Pierre Sauvage, and J. Fraser Stoddart.\n- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201703216\n- https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ar500012a\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325339604_Chirality_in_rotaxanes_and_catenanes\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309762846_Properties_and_emerging_applications_of_mechanically_interlocked_ligands\n- https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01758",

Most macromolecular cages that are formed through self-assembly are sensitive to pH, temperature, and solvent polarity.\n- https://doi.org/10.1039/A827417Z\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/378469a0",

Classified as a diarylethene, it features a central ethylene moiety with one phenyl group substituent on each end of the carbon\u2013carbon double bond. It has an (E) stereochemistry, meaning that the phenyl groups are located on opposite sides of the double bond, the opposite of its geometric isomer, cis-stilbene. Trans-stilbene occurs as a white crystalline solid at room temperature and is highly soluble in organic solvents. It can be converted to cis-stilbene photochemically, and further reacted to produce phenanthrene.",

Spiropyrans were discovered in the early twentieth century. However, it was in the middle twenties when Fisher and Hirshbergin observed their photochromic characteristics and reversible reaction. In 1952, Fisher and co-workers announced for the first time photochromism in spiropyrans. Since then, there have been many studies on photochromic compounds that have continued up to the present.",

For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as textures). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).",

They are conceptually related to other mechanically interlocked molecular architectures, such as rotaxanes, molecular knots or molecular Borromean rings. Recently the terminology \"mechanical bond\" has been coined that describes the connection between the macrocycles of a catenane.

The base is approximately 40 nanometers high and is fixed to a glass plate in solution via chemical bonds on a glass plate. A rotor arm of up to 500 nanometers in length is mounted on the base so that it can rotate. Another crucial component for the motor to work as intended is a platform between the base and the rotor arm. This platform contains obstacles that influence the movement of the rotor arm. The rotor arm must bend upward a little to pass the obstacles and rotate, similar to a ratchet.",

Skeletal muscle can be viewed as a biomechanical device with various interacting components including the autonomic nerves for impulse transmission, vasculature for efficient oxygenation, and embedded regulatory and metabolic machinery for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The \u201comics\u201d revolution has propelled a new era in muscle research, allowing us to discern minute details of molecular cross\u2010talk required for effective coordination between the myriad interacting components for efficient muscle function. The objective of this review is to provide a systems\u2010level, comprehensive mapping the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle structure and function, in health and disease. We begin this review with a focus on molecular mechanisms underlying muscle tissue development (myogenesis), with an emphasis on satellite cells and muscle regeneration. We next review the molecular structure and mechanisms underlying the many structural components of the muscle: neuromuscular junction, sarcomere, cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and vasculature surrounding muscle. We highlight aberrant molecular mechanisms and their possible clinical or pathophysiological relevance. We particularly emphasize the impact of environmental stressors (inflammation and oxidative stress) in contributing to muscle pathophysiology including atrophy, hypertrophy, and fibrosis.",

It acts as a selective barrier, allowing certain substances to pass through while blocking others.\n\nTargeting the blood-brain barrier as a therapeutic strategy involves developing therapies that are specifically designed to cross the BBB and reach the brain. These therapies may be used to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including brain tumors, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.\n\nThere are several ways that researchers are attempting to target the blood-brain barrier as a therapeutic strategy. One approach is to use drugs that are able to cross the BBB, either by actively transporting them across the barrier or by modifying the structure of the drugs to make them more permeable. Another approach is to use gene therapies, which involve delivering genes directly to the brain through the blood-brain barrier.\n\nOverall, targeting the blood-brain barrier as a therapeutic strategy is a promising approach for treating a range of neurological conditions, but it also poses significant challenges due to the complexity and selective nature of the BBB.\n\n### Articles:\n\n[The blood-brain barrier: Physiology and strategies for drug delivery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169409X19302388?via%3Dihub)",

This can be achieved by incorporating sensors and actuators, as well as AI algorithms that allow the robot to process information from its environment and make decisions about how to act.\n\nAnother aspect of neurorobotics is the use of robots as a tool for investigating the nervous system. Robots can be used to simulate different aspects of the nervous system, such as the movement of joints or the processing of sensory information, and can help researchers to understand how the nervous system works.\n\nSome of the applications of neurorobotics include:\n\nRehabilitation robotics: using robots to aid in the recovery of motor function in individuals with neurological disorders or injuries\nBiomedical research: Using robots to study the biology of the nervous system, and how to replicate it.\nProsthetics: Creating robotic limbs that can be controlled by the nervous system.\nIntelligent transportation: implementing neurorobotics in vehicles to improve their safety, efficiency, and ability to adapt to changing conditions.\nAssistive technology: Developing robots to assist people with disabilities or elderly people.\nIt's important to note that neurorobotics is a rapidly evolving field, and researchers are still exploring ways to integrate neural models and AI into robotic systems. Also, there's a need for cross-disciplinary collaboration to fully leverage the potential of neurorobotics and to address the ethical implications of the field.",

This allows individuals to receive treatment and support while they are at home or on the go, and can make it easier for them to stick to their treatment plan.\n\nMedication reminders: Many brain disorders require individuals to take medications on a regular basis. Mobile apps can be used to set reminders for medication doses and help individuals to stay on schedule.\n\nEducation and self-help: Mobile apps can provide individuals with information about their condition and strategies for managing their symptoms. This can help to increase individuals' understanding of their condition and empower them to take an active role in managing their symptoms.\n\nSocial support: Mobile apps can provide individuals with a sense of connection to others who are going through similar experiences. They can also connect individuals with mental health professionals who can provide support and guidance.\n\nData collection: Mobile apps can be used to collect data on an individual's symptoms and daily activities, which can be used to better understand the condition and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment interventions.\n\nCognitive training: There are mobile apps that aim to improve cognitive abilities like memory, attention, and problem-solving by providing brain training exercises. This kind of apps could be beneficial for conditions such as dementia, ADHD, and traumatic brain injuries.\n\nIt's important to note that mobile apps should be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as they are not intended to replace traditional treatments and should be used in conjunction with other forms of therapy. Additionally, it's always good to read reviews, check for certifications and ensure the app is backed by scientific evidence before using it.",

For example, a personalized treatment for depression might involve the use of a specific antidepressant medication based on the patient's genetic profile or other factors.\n\nThere are several advantages to personalized treatments. For example, personalized treatments may be more effective than standard treatments because they are tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Personalized treatments may also have fewer side effects because they are specifically designed for the individual patient.",

This approach is designed to optimize the effectiveness of the treatment and to minimize the risk of side effects.\n\nDynamic control of treatment efficiency is particularly important in the field of neuroscience, where conditions such as depression, anxiety, and epilepsy can be complex and may require frequent adjustments to treatment. For example, a patient with epilepsy may need to have their dosage of antiepileptic medication adjusted based on the frequency and severity of their seizures. Similarly, a patient with depression may need to have their dosage of antidepressant medication adjusted based on their response to treatment.\n\nDynamic control of treatment efficiency can be achieved through the use of monitoring technologies, such as wearable sensors, that can provide real-time data on the patient's response to treatment. This data can be used to make adjustments to the treatment in real-time, allowing the healthcare provider to optimize the effectiveness of the treatment while minimizing the risk of side effects.\n\nOverall, dynamic control of treatment efficiency is an important approach that can help to optimize the effectiveness of treatments for neurological and psychiatric conditions.",

This can be used to detect subtle changes in brain structure that may be associated with disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and dementia.\n\nNetwork-based analysis: This is a computational approach that uses graph theory and complex network analysis to study the brain as a complex network of interconnected regions. This technique can be used to identify patterns of connectivity in the brain that are disrupted in certain disorders.\n\nAdvanced functional connectivity : Using sophisticated techniques like dynamic functional connectivity, temporal and spatial ICA, graph theory and more, to detect not only the strength but also the patterns of connections and interactions between different regions in the brain.\n\nQuantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM): is a novel MRI-based technique that allow for the quantification of iron concentration within the brain.

For example, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning could lead to the development of more sophisticated mental health assessments that can detect early signs of mental health issues and help identify individuals who may be at risk.\n\nAnother way technology could improve mental wellbeing planning is through the use of mobile health applications that provide individuals with access to mental health resources and support. Mobile apps, for example, can be programmed to deliver tailored interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practices, that can help individuals to manage stress and improve mood.\n\nAdditionally, with the increasing understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of mental health disorders, it may be possible to develop new treatments and interventions that can target specific neural pathways and mechanisms, leading to more effective and personalized treatments.\n\nIt's important to note that while technology can play a role in mental wellbeing planning, it is not a panacea. It is crucial that mental wellbeing planning also includes social support, a healthy lifestyle, access to mental health care, and addressing systemic issues that contribute to mental health problems such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of social inclusion.\n",

Biomarkers are measurable indicators of a disease, such as a specific protein in the blood or a certain pattern of brain activity. Advances in technology, such as imaging techniques, and in our understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of brain disorders, could lead to the development of new biomarkers that can be used to identify individuals at risk of developing a disorder.\n\nAnother potential future is the use of AI and machine learning techniques to analyze data collected from wearable devices and other sources to detect early signs of brain disorders. This could involve using data from sensors to detect patterns in an individual's behavior or physiological data that could indicate an increased risk of developing a disorder.\n\nAdditionally, another way to improve early diagnostics is to involve patients and caregivers in the process, through screening questionnaires, self-report assessments and other means, to detect signs and symptoms of brain disorders.\n\nIt's important to note that early diagnosis is just one step in the process of improving outcomes for individuals with brain disorders, and it should be followed by appropriate treatment and support.

This approach allows for less invasive access to the brain and potentially less damage to the surrounding tissue.\nEndovascular BCIs consist of a small catheter that is inserted into a vein in the neck or head, which is then guided through the blood vessels to the brain. At the end of the catheter is a small probe containing electrodes that can record neural activity. This activity is then transmitted to an external controller, similar to implanted microelectrodes BCIs, which processes the signals and sends commands to a computer or other device.",

            "desc": "\"Most groups, though, focus on the eye and employ an intraocular implant. Some designs for the implant are quite new, for example, employing an optoelectronic system that theoretically could give a stimulating pixel density of up to 2500 pix/mm2 (Palanker et al., 2005). Others have taken novel surgical approaches. In this regard, Tokuda et al. (2007) have implanted a multichip stimulator into a scleral pocket to achieve suprachoroidal transretinal stimulation. They were able to elicit electrically evoked potentials (EEPs) in the visual cortex using this device. The use of localized chemical release (e.g., neurotransmitters) from the implanted device has been proposed (Peterman et al., 2004) as well as a neural interface that utilizes vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotube pillars as microelectrodes (Wang et al., 2006). Many other approaches from groups in different countries are under investigation but a summary of these activities is outside the scope of the present article. Most groups of researchers, however, have taken a more direct approach with the implantation of more conventional electrodes directly on the retina using a subretinal or epiretinal approach. In the subretinal approach, the electronic implant is placed in the subretinal space between the pigment epithelial cells and the dead/dying photoreceptors. In the epiretinal approach, the implant is placed on the front surface of the retina, i.e., the ganglion cell layer. Applicability of such approaches has been reviewed in several publications including Zrenner (2002); Weiland et al. (2005), Winter et al. (2007) and the recent book by Humayun et al. (2007).\"\n\n[Source: Chader et al., 2009](https://pubmed-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.browser.cbs.mpg.de/19660665/)\n\n",

Here are a few examples:\n\n#### Delivery: \nOne of the main challenges of gene therapy is delivering the therapeutic gene to the appropriate cells in the body. Researchers are working on various approaches to deliver genes, including using viruses to carry the gene into cells, using liposomes to deliver the gene, and using physical methods such as electroporation to introduce the gene into cells. However, these approaches can be inefficient and may have limitations.\n\n#### Immune response: \nThe immune system may recognize the viral vectors or other delivery vehicles used in gene therapy as foreign and mount an immune response against them. This can limit the effectiveness of gene therapy and may cause side effects.\n\n#### Off-target effects: \nGene therapy may have unintended effects on other genes or pathways in the body, known as off-target effects. These off-target effects may cause unwanted side effects or may interfere with the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n#### Long-term effects: \nIt is not always clear how gene therapy will affect an individual in the long term. Some gene therapies may have long-term effects that are not immediately apparent, and it is important to carefully monitor individuals who have received gene therapy to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nOverall, gene therapy is a promising approach to the treatment of genetic disorders and other conditions, but it also faces several challenges.

Neuroinflammation is the inflammation of the cells, tissues, and molecules of the brain and nervous system. It is thought to play a role in the development and progression of various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and depression.\n\nThere are several ways in which neuroinflammation may be targeted as a therapeutic strategy. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may be used to reduce inflammation. Other approaches may involve the use of immune modulators, such as corticosteroids, or the use of specialized proteins called cytokines to regulate the immune response.\n\nTargeting neuroinflammation as a therapeutic strategy is an emerging area of research that has the potential to improve the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, it is important to note that the relationship between neuroinflammation and these conditions is complex and is not fully understood. Further research is needed to determine the most effective approaches to targeting neuroinflammation as a therapeutic strategy.",

Developing new drugs that specifically target these targets may lead to more effective treatments for these conditions.\n\nIn addition, as the population ages and the prevalence of neurological and psychiatric disorders increases, the demand for effective treatments will also rise.

In addition, the effectiveness of brain stimulation can vary from person to person, and it may not work for everyone.\n\nAnother challenge is that brain stimulation can have side effects, including headache, dizziness, and muscle twitching. In some cases, brain stimulation may also cause more serious side effects, such as seizures or cognitive changes.\n\nFinally, brain stimulation may not be appropriate for everyone.

This can help to protect the brain and improve the symptoms of certain neurological disorders.\n\n# Delaying age-related neurodegeneration: \nExercise has been known to help in slowing down the process of certain neurodegenerative disorders, specially in aging population.\n\nFor specific disorders like Parkinson's, regular physical activity has been shown to improve motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and balance. In multiple sclerosis, exercise can help to improve muscle strength, endurance, and balance. In addition, it can have positive effect on fatigue and depression which are common in the disease.\n\nIt's important to note that while exercise is beneficial for the nervous system, it's also important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting an exercise program, especially if you have a specific neurological disorder or other medical conditions.",

ECM plays a crucial role in tissue architecture, cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and homeostasis (Hynes, 2009; J\u00e4rvel\u00e4inen et al., 2009; Schaefer and Schaefer, 2010). The ECM is composed of various macromolecules, including proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, elastin, and collagen, which are secreted by cells and assembled into a dynamic and hierarchical structure (Frantz et al., 2010; Hynes, 2009; J\u00e4rvel\u00e4inen et al., 2009; Schaefer and Schaefer, 2010). While ECMs distant from cells are more static, accumulate age-related damage, and are not remodeled, ECM attached to cells can be continuously remodeled and regulated by a range of enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, during development, tissue repair, and aging (Bonnans et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2011). During the aging process, the ECM undergoes various changes, including decreased synthesis, altered composition, and impaired crosslinking, which can lead to tissue dysfunction and diseases such as cancer, fibrosis, and atherosclerosis (Birch, 2018; Ewald, 2020; Statzer et al., 2022a). The ECM can also serve as a diagnostic tool and biomarker for various diseases, as it reflects the biochemical and mechanical changes in tissues and organs (Brunton-O\u2019Sullivan et al., 2021; Komosinska-Vassev et al., 2022). For instance, the measurement of ECM components, such as collagen and elastin, can be used to diagnose and monitor fibrosis and cardiovascular diseases (Andriani et al., 2018; Brunton-O\u2019Sullivan et al., 2021; Petersen et al., 2020). Modulating the composition and structure of the ECM can also be utilized as a therapeutic target to improve tissue function and repair (Harisi and Jeney, 2015; Huang et al., 2021; Walraven and Hinz, 2018).\n\nCompanies:  \n[Glycanage](https://glycanage.com/)  \n[Revel](https://www.revelpharmaceuticals.com/)  \n[Boston Matrix](https://bostonmatrix.org/)  \n[Isterian](https://www.isterian.com)  \n[Biochange Ltd](https://biochange.life/)  \n[Elastrin](https://www.elastrin.com/)  \n[ScarTec](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/scartec-therapeutics)  \n[One Skin Technologies](https://www.oneskintechnologies.com/)\n\nLabs:  \n[Ewald Lab](https://www.ewaldlab.com/)  \n[Duer Lab](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/duer/research/extracellular-matrix-ageing-and-disease)  \n[Hansen Lab](https://www.hansenproteomics.com/research)  \n[Hynes Lab](http://hynes-lab.mit.edu/)  \n\nSeminar:  \n[Collin Ewald](https://foresight.org/summary/collin-ewald-aging-the-extracellular-matrix/)",

Besides waste elimination, the glymphatic system also facilitates brain-wide distribution of several compounds, including glucose, lipids, amino acids, growth factors, and neuromodulators. Intriguingly, the glymphatic system function mainly during sleep and is largely disengaged during wakefulness. The biological need for sleep across all species may therefore reflect that the brain must enter a state of activity that enables elimination of potentially neurotoxic waste products, including \u03b2-amyloid.\n\nLabs:  \n[Nedergaard Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/nedergaard.aspx)",

The location of the HSPGs in the plasma membrane works as a gatekeeper of ECM-cell signaling. And on the cell surface, HSPGs serve as a docking point to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Yu and Woessner, 2000). This strategic location allows HSPGs to act as a cell directory through the ECM and promote invadopodia (Kelly et al., 1994).\n\nHSPG core proteins\u2013glypican and syndecan\u2013have been observed in the developmental signaling mediation. Syndecans modulate axon pathfinding activity of the Slit-Robo pathway (H\u00e4cker et al., 2005). In  Drosophila melanogaster, glypicans regulate embryonic development via Wnt, Hh, and Dpp/TGF\u03b2 pathways (Nybakken and Perrimon, 2002). In C. elegans, mutations in HSPGs can affect normal lifespan and are required for longevity (Ewald et al., 2016; Teuscher et al., 2022).\n",

And experiments using knockout mice implicate proteoglycans to be the stabilizer in the collagen-elastin network (Danielson et al., 1997; Maccarana et al., 2009).

These mutations result in an abnormal composition of ECM, leading to a range of symptoms, including skeletal and cardiovascular anomalies, joint hypermobility, and skin fragility manifested in diseases such as Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos, Hunter, Morquio, and Sanfilippo syndromes (Batzios et al., 2013; Benet\u00f3 et al., 2020; Byers and Murray, 2014; de la Fuente-Alonso et al., 2021; Iozzo and Schaefer, 2015; J\u00e4rvel\u00e4inen et al., 2009; Walimbe and Panitch, 2020).",

However, total collagen over total protein assessments in mice showed that collagens make up 12-17% of total protein (Tarnutzer et al., 2022). The collagen family comprises 29 distinct members, all of which possess a signature triple-helical domain structure (Owczarzy et al., 2020; Ricard-Blum, 2011; Shenoy et al., 2022) and has been extensively reviewed by Ricard-Blum and others (Owczarzy et al., 2020; Ricard-Blum, 2011; Shenoy et al., 2022). Quantitative ECM-enriched proteomics of entire mice revealed collagen type I as the most prevalent form of collagen (Tarnutzer et al., 2022).\n\nCollagen, a fibrous protein that forms long, thin fibers, imparts tensile strength and elasticity to the ECM, enabling it to withstand mechanical forces such as those generated by the movement and contraction of surrounding cells and tissues. Collagen is also a major component of the ECM of connective tissues, such as skin, tendons, and ligaments, where collagen fibers are organized into complex, regular patterns that give these tissues their characteristic mechanical properties (Mouw et al., 2014; Rozario and DeSimone, 2010). In addition to its structural role, collagen also plays a key role in the signaling and regulation of ECM functions. Collagen can interact with various molecules, such as growth factors, enzymes, and other ECM components, to modulate their activity and regulate their effects on surrounding cells (Bonnans et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2011). \n",

Besides providing architectural support, the lung ECM conditions cell behavior through changes in the stiffness and composition of its proteins (Burgess et al., 2016; Gilpin et al., 2017; Herrera et al., 2022). The pathology of lung fibrosis is then associated with the loss of ECM homeostasis and the breakdown of its environment\u2013creating a positive feedback loop to enforce fibrogenesis (Deng et al., 2020; Hackett and Osei, 2021). It is, therefore, self-evident that any impairment due to lung fibrosis requires interventions to recapture ECM homeostasis.\n",

These transitions in pathology usher increased matrix stiffness that leads to undesirable cardiac function (Hinderer and Schenke-Layland, 2019). \n\nThe ECM network provides structural integrity, promotes force transmission, and relays crucial signal transduction to vascular and interstitial tissues and cardiomyocytes. Any changes in the cardiac ECM homeostasis are therefore critically felt and may cause reduced ejection fraction, heart arrest, and/or myocardial matrix stiffening, disturbance in electric conductance, and possibly death (Frangogiannis, 2019a; Hinderer and Schenke-Layland, 2019). \n\nBecause the prognosis of cardiac fibrosis is often deleterious, exploiting matricellular proteins has been proposed as a possible therapy to modify the events of adverse remodeling.

The more attainable goal of engineering a bioartificial heart through stem cell-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation by using cardiac matrices as a scaffold is yet in its infancy (Ott et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2018). \n",

When the symptoms of liver fibrosis become acute, it can result in cirrhosis leading to portal hypertension and liver failure, which frequently necessitates a liver transplant (Bataller and Brenner, 2005). In industrialized nations, liver fibrosis is often caused by hepatitis C infection, alcohol, and fatty liver--also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Bataller and Brenner, 2005).\n\nECM dysregulation is often attributed as the characteristic of fibrosis, with loss of homeostasis leading to impaired wound healing. ECM dysregulation causes alteration in the biomechanics and architecture of the lungs (Walraven and Hinz, 2018). Even though the liver is renowned for its regenerative abilities, persistent irritation can lead to fibrosis (Michalopoulos, 2007; Ortiz et al., 2021). When the injury is unabated, wound healing fails to function effectively, and fibrosis ensues. Fibrosis causes massive ECM deposition and scar formation, which leads to hepatic stellate cell failure (Marra, 1999).\n \nMany therapeutic strategies have been emerging to inhibit fibrosis from developing. These include anti-inflammatory liver protection, hepatic stellate cell inhibitors, suppressor of ECM production, and or targeting ECM degradation. Gene therapy is also in the pipeline to target fibrosis (Tan et al., 2021).\n",

In 2020 alone, cancer affected approximately 18.1 million globally (WCRF International, 2022). The ECM plays a crucial role in the formation of the cancer microenvironment (Bissell and Hines, 2011). Increased ECM deposits and crosslinks have been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis by providing the chemical and physical signals that are necessary for tumor development and invasion (Kim et al., 2011; Provenzano et al., 2008). Moreover, tumor cells have been found to influence the deposition of fibronectin, collagen, and tenascin C (Kii et al., 2010; Xiong and Xu, 2016), and a growing body of evidence suggests that ECM deposition promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis by helping cancer cells to proliferate and survive (Aoudjit and Vuori, 2012).

            "desc": "The loss of cellular identity is a phenomenon that occurs when cells lose their characteristic features and become more similar to each other (Yuan et al., 2019). This can happen during the development of cancer when cells undergo a process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Scott et al., 2019). During EMT, cells lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire mesenchymal traits, such as increased motility and invasiveness. This allows them to break away from the primary tumor and migrate to other parts of the body, where they can form secondary tumors or metastases (Ribatti et al., 2020). The ECM plays a crucial role in the loss of cellular identity during EMT (Kim et al., 2017). In the context of cancer, the ECM can provide the physical and chemical cues that are necessary for EMT to occur (Walker et al., 2018). For example, certain ECM molecules, such as fibronectin, can promote EMT by activating signaling pathways that drive the loss of epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of mesenchymal traits (Lamouille et al., 2014). Additionally, the ECM can provide mechanical cues that can drive EMT by stretching and deforming the cells, which can activate signaling pathways that promote the loss of cellular identity (Miller et al., 2020). However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which tumor cells produce ECM and its role in remodeling the microenvironment in order to develop targeted cancer treatments (Venning et al., 2015).\n\nAs people age, the dermis also undergoes remodeling of the ECM and impaired cellularity (Badi, 2019; Tigges et al., 2014). However, it is unclear whether these changes are due to changes in fibroblasts. Salzer et al. studied whether different diets affected dermal fibroblasts in mice and their impact on lifespan. They found that as time passed, the definition of old fibroblasts became blurred, and even when present on the youthful dermis, fibroblasts were still indistinguishable. Old fibroblasts also showed decreased expression of genes involved in ECM formation (Salzer et al., 2018). Paradoxically, these old fibroblasts gained adipogenic traits similar to those in the neonatal state. When placed on a caloric restriction, these negative effects were either reversed or reduced. By contrast, a high-fat diet exacerbated the negative effects of aging. These results suggest that loss of cell identity may be one of the underlying mechanisms of aging (Fontana and Partridge, 2015; Salzer et al., 2018; Sedej, 2018).\n\nStiffened ECM can also drive the pathogenic expression of matricellular proteins by fibroblasts, leading to the conversion of muscle stem cells into fibrogenic cells. This process, known as a fibrogenic conversion, can contribute to sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. This occurs through the activation of the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway, which is triggered by the stiffened ECM. Overall, the ECM plays a key role in the loss of cellular identity during EMT, which is an essential step in the development of cancer and its metastasis, as well as in the development of sarcopenia (Stearns-Reider et al., 2017).\n",

In-vivo stem cell induction has been shown to restore the age-related decline in mice (Lavasani et al., 2012; Rando and Chang, 2012; Ren et al., 2017), highlighting the important role that tissue stem cells play in maintaining homeostasis and tissue regeneration (Cai et al., 2022; Neves et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2017).\n\nThe ECM is critical in regulating stem cell pluripotency, differentiation, tissue repair, and regeneration (Gattazzo et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2020). Tenascin-C, specifically, is expressed by bone marrow niche cells, which promote the regeneration of hematopoietic stem cells (Nakamura-Ishizu et al., 2012). However, chronic mechanical stress can cause the ECM to stiffen, impairs mechanotransduction, and leads to stem cell exhaustion through ECM remodeling (Gattazzo et al., 2014). In this process, enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can break down ECM molecules and cause the ECM to stiffen, impairing stem cells' ability to respond to mechanical signals and maintain their proper functions (Freitas-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2017).\n\nThese findings suggest that stem cell rejuvenation could potentially be enhanced for novel therapies by manipulating the mechanisms of the ECM (Cai et al., 2022; Watt and Huck, 2013).\n",

This process can be classified into two categories: non-programmed cell death (Non-PCD), also known as necrosis, which is the result of the irreversible cell damage caused by extreme physical or chemical environments (Majno and Joris, 1995), and programmed cell death (PCD), which can be further subclassified into lytic and non-lytic cell death (Jorgensen et al., 2017).\n\nLytic cell death includes necroptosis and pyroptosis (Jorgensen and Miao, 2015), while non-lytic cell death, such as apoptosis, is essential for maintaining tissue organization and ensuring the appropriate number of cells (Makino et al., 2000). The ability of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to remodel is crucial for regulating cell behavior (Lu et al., 2011), and apoptosis has been found to be involved in several diseases, including those affecting the kidneys (Savill, 1994; Thompson, 1995). Unlike necrosis, apoptosis does not elicit an inflammatory response, and phagocytes are responsible for removing the resulting apoptotic bodies (Fuchs and Steller, 2011; Yang et al., 2022). A study of rat kidneys found that glomerular cell apoptosis was associated with glomerular cell loss and accumulation of ECM, leading to glomerulosclerosis (Sugiyama et al., 1996). Additionally, it was found that mesangial cells were protected from apoptosis by the basement membrane matrix, which induced their survival. However, when the expression of \u03b21 integrin was suppressed using antisense oligonucleotides, apoptosis of mesangial cells was increased (Makino et al., 2000). These findings suggest that the regulation of mesangial cells is dependent on the ECM surrounding them via integrins.\n\nGiven the close relationship between mesangial cell proliferation and apoptosis, there is potential for developing novel therapeutic strategies for renal diseases that involve manipulating apoptosis (Makino et al., 2000).\n",

Because of the diverse functions of mitochondria, any dysfunction in these organelles can have a significant impact on human health. \n\nThere is a bidirectional relationship between the ECM and mitochondria. Cell-ECM interactions can directly or indirectly modulate mitochondria through the actin cytoskeleton (Fletcher and Mullins, 2010). This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of metastasis, where mitochondria serve as the primary energy source for cell migration (Yanes and Rainero, 2022). In turn, mitochondrial depolarization and oxidative phosphorylation can influence the ECM through cell-ECM adhesion and MMP-dependent ECM degradation (van Waveren et al., 2006). Mitochondrial homeostasis and adaptation (mitohormesis) are interlinked with ECM-integrin cytoskeleton remodeling in human stem cells and C. elegans important for lifespan extension (Ding et al., 2008; Munk\u00e1csy et al., 2016; Schinzel et al., 2019; Tharp et al., 2021)\n",

When this process fails, it can have significant negative consequences for cellular adaptation and homeostasis (Ewald, 2020). Impaired mechanotransduction can lead to a range of problems, including disrupted tissue development and function, tissue degeneration, and in some cases, the development of diseases such as fibrosis or cancer (Humphrey et al., 2014). Understanding the role of mechanotransduction in the ECM and how it can be disrupted is an important area of research with potential implications for the treatment of a variety of conditions.\n\nDamages to ECM can be read out by changes in forces sensed by integrins as cell-surface ECM receptors. Integrins transduce these physical forces either through cytoskeleton remodeling linked to the nucleus or changing kinase cascades signaling into the nucleus to reprogram gene expression (Humphrey et al., 2014).  A moderate reduction of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) caused favorable function in increasing lifespan in C. elegans and D. melanogaster (Goddeeris et al., 2003; Kumsta et al., 2014). In particular, C. elegans showed an increased lifespan while preserving cytoskeletal integrity (Goddeeris et al., 2003). Further investigation through RNAi screening found pat-4/ILK and pat-6/Parvin depletion to be responsible for its increase (Goddeeris et al., 2003; Vitiello et al., 2021). In Drosophila, mortality, and behavioral aging delay were observed in the loss-of-function myospheroid gene mutations that encode for \u03b21-integrin\u2013the binding partner of the ILK (Hansen et al., 2005). Coronin-7 (Coro7), necessary for proper cytoskeletal functions, has been associated with prolonged lifespan in mice (Statzer and Ewald, 2020; Vitiello et al., 2021). Also, cytoskeleton remodeling has been known to be closely correlated to ECM remodeling. And ECM remodeling has a critical role in mechanotransduction and improved health span (Ewald, 2020; Ewald et al., 2015; Rapisarda et al., 2017).\n",

While universally occurring throughout the body with age, fibrosis is seen in accelerated forms both in fibrotic diseases and after injury. \n\nMany fibrotic disorders are caused by the loss of ECM homeostasis, which creates an imbalance in wound healing and causes irreversible structural damage to biophysical properties (Ortiz et al., 2021; Walraven and Hinz, 2018). As more than a third of the developed nations suffer from mortality due to fibrotic disorders (Rockey DC et al., 2015), understanding the mechanisms behind ECM maintenance is vital in extending the health span globally.\n\nThere are currently no reliable biomarkers for diagnosing fibrotic diseases, and the current non-invasive method for discovering these diseases is unreliable and often leads to a diagnosis too late when the damage is already irreparable (Gaudet and Popovich, 2014).

The matrisome can be divided into the core matrisome, which forms the actual ECM, includes proteins such as collagens, laminins, and proteoglycans, and the associated matrisome, which includes proteins such as ECM remodelers or proteins that associate with the matrix (Ewald, 2020; Hynes and Naba, 2012; Sacher et al., 2021). ECM receptors, such as integrins, play a crucial role in cell-ECM interactions and are involved in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling (Hynes, 2002; Schwartz, 2010). ECM remodelers, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), are enzymes that modify the ECM by degrading or synthesizing ECM components (Bourboulia and Stetler-Stevenson, 2010; Brew and Nagase, 2010; Visse and Nagase, 2003). These proteins are important for ECM remodeling during tissue development, repair, and remodeling processes. Given these ECM functions, not surprisingly, there is evidence that changes in the expression and activity of ECM proteins and ECM remodelers may contribute to age-related changes in tissue structure and function (Ewald, 2020; Lofaro et al., 2021; Statzer et al., 2021; Teuscher et al., 2022).\n",

Proteases, such as MMPs, play a crucial role in ECM remodeling and are connected to various illnesses, including cancer and chronic inflammation (Manicone and McGuire, 2008). The regulation of protease activity and bond formation within the ECM through small molecules can be achieved by either stimulating or suppressing protease activity or promoting ECM bond formation (Skrzydlewska et al., 2005). This approach has the potential to target a wide range of diseases and aging-related conditions, including angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, and epidermal aging.\n\nThere is growing evidence that MMPs have a significant influence on angiogenesis beyond ECM remodeling. MMPs have been found to release ECM-bound angiogenic factors, detach pericytes from blood vessels, and degrade endothelial cell-cell adhesions (Rundhaug, 2005; Tang et al., 2005). For example, a study on mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) showed that treatment with Marimastat increased the number of blood vessels covered by pericytes while the total blood vessel number remained unchanged. Inhibiting MMP activity resulted in an increase in pericyte-covered blood vessel numbers and seemed to stabilize the integrity of the infected lung tissue. Additionally, increased delivery and/or retention of Marimastat was observed in treated mice, leading to improved drug efficacy (Xu et al., 2018).\n\nNatural compounds, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have also been found to control ECM homeostasis and longevity through different mechanisms (Statzer et al., 2022b).

These obstructions are caused by several processes, such as inflammations, swellings, mucus buildups, and impairment of the airway lining (Rabe et al., 2007). Constant inflammation caused by smoking and air pollution is thought to be a major contributor to COPD pathogenesis (Finkelstein et al., 1995; World Health Organization, 2022).\n\nThe ECM plays a critical role in the architecture of the airway structure. In COPD patients, however, major deviations of the ECM components are observed in all of its lung recesses (Annoni et al., 2012). It is postulated that these deviations cannot be overcome in COPD patients and contributes to the lack of airflow into the lungs\u2013further causing a deleterious impact on the patient's health (Annoni et al., 2012). Past findings of COPD have been characterized by the reduction of elastin and proteoglycan but an increase in collagen in the alveoli (Cardoso et al., 1993; Chrzanowski et al., 1980; van Straaten et al., 1999). However, we currently lack an understanding of the precise mechanism behind how ECM influences COPD. It is hoped that the transplanting of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) may play a role by inducing the regeneration and reassembly of damaged lungs. Developing artificial scaffolds, instructed with cues to uphold the microenvironment, and finetuning biomechanics for optimal MSC curative properties may be the future direction of COPD treatment (Elowsson Rendin et al., 2021).\n",

Reduced elastin in those with WBS would therefore have their ability of elastic properties necessary for the normal function of arteries impaired (Collins, 2013; Grant et al., 2017; Kozel et al., 2014).

Collagen and elastin support the architecture of arterial biomechanics. These proteins constitute the majority of arterial wall structural makeup, and deterioration in either or both of these proteins can create havoc in arterial health (Briones et al., 2010; Kelleher et al., 2004). Therefore, any alteration in quantity or quality is a determinant factor in diseases often associated with aging, namely: diabetes, chronic renal failure, and hypertension (Briones et al., 2010; Lacolley et al., 2017).\n\nCardiovascular and renal drugs currently available in the market have yet to capture the elusive mechanisms underlying the structural components of the disease. Further investigations and therapeutic interventions targeting the structural maintenance of the ECM will therefore result in a reduction in the aforementioned diseases and increase the quality of life of the aging population (Lacolley et al., 2017).\n",

In the bone ECM, collagen constitutes the majority of its makeup. And with the progression of time, collagen undergoes a decline in quality due to AGEs and causes abnormalities in bone remodeling (Shiraki et al., 2008). While higher levels of AGEs were observed in patients who have had fractures, correlation does not necessitate causation (Dyer et al., 1991). \n\nNew findings suggest that noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) may consort with collagen in the structural and mechanical properties of the bone matrix.

            "desc": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease, with an estimated prevalence of over 50% in individuals over the age of 65 (Dillon et al., 2006; Rahmati et al., 2017). OA is characterized by abnormal bone remodeling and degeneration of the articular cartilage, leading to pain and physical and financial impairments in the elderly population (Blagojevic et al., 2010; Goldring, 2012; Neogi and Zhang, 2013; Sandell and Aigner, 2001).\n\nWhile aging is considered a major risk factor for the development of OA, the exact mechanisms of its pathogenesis remain poorly understood (Lotz and Loeser, 2012). Aging has been shown to disrupt the homeostasis of the ECM, resulting in loss of integrity and deterioration of its architecture. These changes are thought to contribute to the development of OA, with its associated increased inflammatory expression, loss of tissue regenerative capacity, and cellular senescence. Chondrocytes, which are quiescent cells responsible for cartilage formation, are believed to play a central role in the initiation and progression of OA (Rahmati et al., 2017). During the progression of the disease, chondrocytes have been observed to promote ECM malformation, forming clusters (Lotz et al., 2010). As aging progresses, chondrocytes also affect proteoglycan synthesis and disrupt their composition (Buckwalter et al., 1993), leading to biomechanical modifications of the ECM and further disrupting its homeostasis.\n\nThere is also evidence suggesting sex differences in the pathogenesis of OA. Women have a higher prevalence of OA than men, particularly after menopause (Buckwalter and Martin, 2006; Srikanth et al., 2005). Hormonal changes that occur during menopause, such as reduced levels of estrogen, may play a role in the increased susceptibility of women to OA (Roman-Blas et al., 2009; Stachenfeld, 2014). Additionally, women may have differences in their ECM composition and structure compared to men, which may contribute to their increased susceptibility to OA (Peshkova et al., 2022). For example, studies have shown that women have lower levels of collagen and proteoglycans in their articular cartilage compared to men (Hernandez et al., 2021). These differences in ECM composition and structure may make women more susceptible to the development of OA and its associated ECM changes (Li and Zheng, 2021). Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms behind these sex differences in the pathogenesis of OA.\n",

            "desc": "Blood vessels become stiffer with advancing age due to elastin loss and accumulation of crosslinks in the ECM of a vessel wall. Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) - a measure of arterial stiffness - is significantly associated with cognitive status (Hanon et al., 2005). PWV appears significantly higher in subjects with vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease than in those without cognitive impairment. Moreover, PWV was higher in subjects with mild cognitive impairment than in those without cognitive impairment. The causality of this relationship was confirmed in a mice study where vascular stiffness was induced by the topical application of calcium chloride on the adventitial region of the carotid artery (Sadekova et al., 2013) which resulted in an increase in the production of cerebral superoxide anion and neurodegeneration.\n\nIntegrating all findings, Iulita et al. draw the hypothesis that increased arterial stiffness and the subsequent excessive pulsatility, through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and inflammation, affect the brain microcirculation and lead to blood-brain-barrier disruption. With compromised cerebral perfusion, the delivery of nutrients and the clearance of toxic products is disrupted, leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction (Iulita et al., 2018).\n\nIn addition, Baidoe-Ansah et al. examined the expression levels of genes related to the neural ECM in the brains of young, aged, and very-aged mice and found that ECM gene expression was downregulated with age, despite the accumulation of ECM proteoglycans. The most significantly downregulated gene was carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (Chst3), which is responsible for modifying proteoglycans. Baidoe-Ansah et al. also found that changes in ECM-related gene expression were associated with a decline in cognitive performance. At the individual level, they found a negative correlation between Chst3 expression and cognitive performance in very aged mice. A trade-off between positive gene effects on certain cognitive tasks and negative effects on others was also observed. Despite an increase in CHST3 protein expression in glial cells, there was no change in the absolute level of chondroitin 6-sulfation (C6S) modification and a decrease in C6S in certain areas of the ECM (Baidoe-Ansah et al., 2022).\n",

            "desc": "As we age, our skin loses its elasticity and firmness due to a decline in the activity of fibroblasts, the cells responsible for producing collagen and other components of the ECM. This loss of ECM leads to systemic inflammaging, which is characterized by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as Il-1 and TNF-\u03b1. Studies have shown that even using hydrating lotions can help to mitigate this effect by reducing the levels of these inflammatory cytokines in elderly individuals (Ye et al., 2019).\n\nA key driver of skin aging is the reduced activity of fibroblasts and their loss of adherence to the ECM. In younger skin, fibroblasts are anchored to the ECM, but this becomes increasingly disorganized with age (Fisher et al., 2009). This can lead to a decline in collagen production and a loss of skin firmness and elasticity. To address this, dermatologists often prescribe medications such as all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin), which has been shown to increase collagen production by up to 80% in the dermis, resulting in a rejuvenated appearance of the skin (Griffiths et al., 1993). Treating C. elegans with tretinoin promotes collagen homeostasis that, is normally lost during aging, and is sufficient to increase lifespan (Statzer et al., 2021). Additionally, other products have been shown to stimulate the production of ECM proteins in skin tissue. For example, glucosamine has been shown to improve hyaluronic acid protection (Gueniche and Castiel-Higounenc, 2017), and heparan sulfate can be used to enhance glycosaminoglycan levels in the skin (Gallo et al., 2015). Both glucosamine and hyaluronic acid supplementation are sufficient to promote collagen homeostasis and longevity in C. elegans (Statzer et al., 2021; Weimer et al., 2014). \n\nAnother factor that contributes to skin aging is the increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade collagen. This is a result of fragmentation that occurs with the fibrils and dysregulated MMP activity which exacerbates the dysfunction of fibroblasts (Xia et al., 2013). UV damage accelerates skin aging in part due to increased MMP activity from the damage response, the abnormal MMP activity also occurs with intrinsic aging.\n\nRapamycin, an FDA-approved drug targeting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex (Li et al., 2014), has been demonstrated to have anti-aging properties on the human epidermis in a clinical trial (Chung et al., 2019). The trial recruited participants older than 40 years of age who exhibited age-related photodamage and dermal atrophy. The results of the study revealed a statistically significant decrease in the levels of the p16INK4A protein, which is indicative of cellular senescence, and an increase in type VII collagen, a crucial component for the basement membrane's structural integrity. Additionally, the study observed an improvement in the clinical appearance of the skin, as well as an improvement in the histological appearance of the skin tissue. These findings suggest that rapamycin may be a promising anti-aging therapy that has been validated for efficacy in human subjects (Chung et al., 2019).\n\nThe future of treatments against skin aging may hinge on the development of effective and stable messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery systems. A recent study by You and colleagues found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced from human dermal fibroblasts and encapsulating mRNA encoding for ECM \u03b11 type-I collagen (COL1A1) induced the formation of collagen-protein grafts and reduced wrinkle formation in the skin of mice with photoaged skin. Additionally, the study found that intradermal delivery of the mRNA-loaded EVs via a microneedle array led to the prolonged and more uniform synthesis and replacement of collagen in the animals' skin. These findings suggest that intradermal delivery of EV-based COL1A1 mRNA may be an effective protein-replacement therapy for the treatment of photoaged skin (You et al., 2023).\n",

However, the turnover of the ECM that is not attached to cells is a relatively slow process, and the accumulation of modified crosslinks with age can result in a decline in the overall quality and quantity of the ECM. To mitigate this decline and preserve the youthful integrity of the ECM, strategies aimed at increasing the rate of ECM turnover and reducing the formation of age-related modifications may prove beneficial. These strategies may include the modulation of specific enzymes involved in ECM turnover, as well as the implementation of lifestyle factors known to promote overall cellular health and vitality. Ultimately, the successful implementation of such strategies may hold significant implications for the maintenance of tissue integrity and the prevention of age-related pathologies.\n",

            "desc": "Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are a group of compounds that contribute to the loss of tissue integrity due to crosslinking with age. The most abundant crosslinks in this group are glucosepane and pentosidine (Monnier et al., 1999; Sj\u00f6berg and Bulterijs, 2009). While it has yet to be clinically proven, it is hypothesized that the accumulation of these crosslinks may be a causal factor in the development of various age-related pathologies. It is believed that their selective breakdown could potentially improve a wide range of ECM-related aging pathologies, including skin atrophy, arterial stiffening, and systemic fibrosis. However, other AGEs may matter more if it turns out that disturbed cell-ECM interactions (e.g., an AGE binding to a RAGE-receptor) are a major driving force behind clinical pathologies within current lifespans (Sainio and J\u00e4rvel\u00e4inen, 2020).\nDespite the potential importance of glucosepane and pentosidine as AGE crosslinks, it remains to be fully elucidated whether they are major causes of aging. This is because no experiments have been conducted in humans to demonstrate the selective removal of these crosslinks. Glucosepane is by far the most abundant crosslink observed in aged human tissue and is over 100 times more abundant than any other crosslink; subsequently, it is of interest to biotech companies. The formation of glucosepane is a well-known chemical reaction, the Amadori reaction, where the amino acid lysine reacts with D-Glucose forming an Amadori product that degrades and gets bound to arginine, forming the final product (Ansari and Dash, 2013; Biemel et al., 2002; Monnier et al., 1999).\nSeveral biotech companies have been founded on the assumption that crosslinks can be broken down, and that such an approach would also restore elasticity as well as the functionality of tissue. One such technology is a glucosepane-breaking enzyme for multiple age-related indications. Conditions, where an effect from removing glucosepane could be anticipated to be observed, would include elasticity of blood vessels, and subsequently, hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and the gradual decrease in the respiratory capacity that occurs with age. It would also be important for skin and cartilage aging, as well as presbyopia, which is secondary to the stiffening of the eye lens that occurs almost universally with age (Rungratanawanich et al., 2021).\nSpecific challenges for clinical translation into humans include finding an enzyme or small molecule that can break down these crosslinks without damaging other vital molecules in the ECM. An enzymatic approach has been pursued so far since enzymes are better at catalyzing the breakdown of substances. However, extracellular enzymes must also be able to penetrate well into the ECM and have a sufficient energy source (such as enough ATP to perform their actions) to effectively break down glucosepane and pentosidine. The need for further research in this area is evident as the selective removal of AGEs such as glucosepane and pentosidine could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions for age-related pathologies.\n",

These polymorphisms might alter ECM integrity in the eye. For instance, polymorphisms found in the promoter region of HTRA1, a secreted serine protease, lead to its overexpression. Transgenic mice overexpressing HTRA1 from retinal pigment epithelial cells resulted in the degradation of fibronectin, fibulin 5, and tropoelastin, thereby fragmenting the ECM (Bruch\u2019s basement membrane) (Vierkotten et al., 2011). Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a type of age-related macular degeneration and a major cause of blindness caused by the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, which can eventually turn into a fibrous plaque or scar (Lim et al., 2012). The subretinal fibrosis in nAMD shares similar molecular processes as fibrosis found in other organs such as the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and skin (Friedlander, 2007).\n\nAlthough there are no fibroblasts in the retina tissue, the initiation of neovascularization can result in the recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of retinal pigment epithelial cells or macrophage to myofibroblasts transdifferentiate, which serve as a direct or indirect source of myofibroblasts (Little et al., 2018). These cells produce ECM, proliferate, and migrate over the basal layers to repair and regenerate damaged tissue. However, in cases of repeated injury or chronic inflammation, fibrotic scarring persists (Ishikawa et al., 2016).\n\nSinclair and his team demonstrated that expressing the Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 genes (Yamanaka factors) in mouse eye retinal ganglion cells restored youthful epigenetic marks and gene expression, promoting axon regeneration after injury and reversing vision loss in glaucoma and aged mice in vivo (Lu et al., 2020). As a corollary, Yamanaka factors may also play a significant role in inducing and influencing ECM regeneration in macular degeneration. Adding weight to the claim are findings such as Oct4 modulating the expression of collagens, which are major components of the ECM (Song et al., 2018). Similarly, Klf4 has been shown to regulate the expression of MMPs, which are enzymes involved in ECM degradation and remodeling (Murgai et al., 2017). \n",

In humans, the stiffening of the ECM with age can lead to dysregulation of YAP1 and cellular senescence (He et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2013). This can cause hindrance in the conversion of mechanical stimuli into cellular responses and altering stem cell differentiation (Pelissier et al., 2014). However, YAP1 activation has also been shown to promote tissue regeneration, but its hyperactivation has been observed in human cancers (Calvo et al., 2013), indicating a need for careful regulation in regenerative medicine (Moya and Halder, 2019).\n\nThe decline in YAP/TAZ activity during physiological aging in stromal cells has been linked to accelerated aging, whereas preserving YAP function has been seen to rejuvenate old cells and suppress senescence-associated inflammation (Sladitschek-Martens et al., 2022). The GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS)\u2013stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, a crucial component of innate immunity, is regulated by YAP/TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) through the preservation of nuclear envelope integrity and regulation of lamin B1 and Actin-related protein 2. Maintaining YAP/TAZ mechanosignaling or inhibiting STING could be potential strategies for promoting healthy aging, as the control of cGAS-STING signaling by YAP/TAZ drives aging (Sladitschek-Martens et al., 2022). In C. elegans, the yap-1 gene is essential for longevity and maintains collagen homeostasis (Teuscher et al., 2022).\n",

The matreotype is defined as the molecular and structural signature of an ECM composition or snapshot associated or caused by a phenotype or cellular status (Ewald, 2020), and can be measured using techniques such as mass spectrometry or immunohistochemistry (Byron et al., 2013; Goddard et al., 2016; Liu and Modo, 2018). The ECM is a dynamic network of molecules that surrounds and supports cells in tissues and organs, and the matreotype concept recognizes it as a modular, heterogeneous system rather than a static entity. By measuring the levels of different ECM molecules and their spatial distribution, a \"fingerprint\" of the ECM can be generated to track changes over time (Ewald, 2020). The matreotype concept has several potential advantages, including being able to comprehensively characterize the ECM, detecting subtle changes, and applying it to a wide range of tissues and organs (Ewald, 2020). Research on the role of the matreotype in cancer, specifically ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma, suggests that understanding the matreotype may help in developing more effective cancer treatments (Pietil\u00e4 et al., 2021). Further research is needed to fully realize the potential of the matreotype to develop reliable measurement methods.",

Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic variables play an important role in the regulation of pathogenic ECM deposition.

The mechanism of vascular calcification is similar to bone metabolism. While the exact mechanism remains elusive, integrity maintenance of vascular ECM and calcification are correlated (Uto et al., 2021). Age-related pathologies such as type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, and increased risk of cardiovascular events are all attributed in part to vascular calcification (Budoff et al., 2011; Ngai et al., 2018). Vascular intima diffuse calcification is associated with matrix vesicles. As part of the ECM component, matrix vesicles are derived from cell budding, cartilage cell, osteoblast, and odontoblast. Matrix vesicles also part from cells to initiate organelle self-governance. These ECM components provide adequate nucleation for calcium crystal formation, and network scaffolding for their calcium deposit is provided by elastins in its vascular walls (Wang et al., 2021).\n\nFurthermore, ECM elastin fibers participate in the calcification of arterial walls. Studies using histochemistry and electron microscopy have divulged two distinct calcification of elastic fiber in the plaques of human atherosclerosis. While structural changes were not detected in the type I calcification, type II showed significant structural changes in the elastin (Bobryshev, 2005). And Khavandgar et al. demonstrated that in matrix Gla protein (MGP)-deficient and ELN haploinsufficient (MGP\u2013/\u2013; ELN\u00b1) murine, calcification was found to be dependent upon the presence of elastin. This led to a significant reduction in arterial calcium deposition in the case of elastin haploinsufficiency (Khavandgar et al., 2014).",

These cytokines modify interstitial matrix synthesis and turnover. And the cytokines also induce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secretion and or activation (Sorokin, 2010). As zinc-dependent endopeptidase, MMPs site-specifically cleave ECM and other proteins (Malemud, 2006; Yong, 2005). Hyaluronan fragmentation increases the activity of MMP during inflammation (Sugahara et al., 2003; Yong, 2005). MMPs increase due to the inflammation release of fragments of tenascin and sulfated proteoglycans--ECM-derived DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) (Brule et al., 2006; Gaudet and Popovich, 2014), resulting in a vicious cycle that fragments ECM. Tissue-remodeling processes facilitated by anomalous ECM fragments are able to modify immune cells and their immune responses in chronically inflamed tissues (Gaudet and Popovich, 2014).",

Our understanding has since grown to include senescence as an ancillary to integrin-signaling complex components in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. Experiments have shown integrin-linked kinase (ILK) deletion to be fatal. However, a moderate reduction of ILK caused favorable function in increasing lifespan in these model organisms [Kumsta, Goddeeris]. In particular, C. elegans showed an increased lifespan while preserving cytoskeletal integrity [Kumsta]. Further investigation through RNAi screening found pat-4/ILK  pat-6/Parvin depletion to be responsible for its increase [Kumsta, Hansen]. In Drosophila, mortality and behavioral aging delay were observed in the loss-of-function myospheroid gene mutations that encode for \u03b21-integrin--the binding partner of the ILK [Goddeeris]. Coronin-7 (Coro7), necessary for proper cytoskeletal functions, has been associated with prolonged lifespan in mice [Vitiello et al.]. Also, cytoskeleton remodeling has been known to be closely correlated to ECM remodeling. And, ECM remodeling has a critical role in mechanotransduction and improved health span [Ewald 2015, Ewald 2019, Statzer and Ewald 2020]. In addition, senescence was perforced by the \u03b23 integrin via the transforming growth factor (TGF)\u2013\u03b2 pathway, and the converse held true with its knockdown besting senescence [Rapisarda]. These findings suggest improved targeting precision in the down-regulation of integrin signaling mechanisms as the potential therapy for senescence [Shin].\n\n- Cecilia Park",

While vitamin D halts pro-inflammatory programs of TH1 cells (Chauss et al., 2022; Minton, 2022), chronic UVR exposure can also increase the probability of photocarcinogenesis by incurring damage to fibroblasts and dermis and accelerating phenotypical aging (Budden et al., 2021; Gilchrest et al., 1999; Watson et al., 2014).\n\nThe quantity of available collagen in the ECM has been attributed to melanoma behavior modifications (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2017; Budden et al., 2021). And it has been shown that collagen-cleaving matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP1) expression is upregulated by UVR-induced fibroblast damage (Levental et al., 2009). However, malignant behavior is also induced by the decreased deposition of collagen (Arnold et al., 2010), suggesting that collagen has a role in carcinogenesis beyond the scaffolding function normally associated with this protein (Budden et al., 2021).\n\nEven though remodeling of the compositional architecture of the ECM induced by prolonged UVR exposure has been attributed to premature skin aging, the exact pathway requires further investigation (Watson et al., 2014).

Lysine and arginine residues frequently become glycated after prolonged exposure to sugars causing age-dependent modifications (Schmidt et al., 1994; Vijg and Campisi, 2008). Matrix stiffening occurs as a result of cross-linking of these AGEs and the steric hinders of enzymatic cleavages required for remodeling. As a response, protease levels are increased, triggering yet another cascade of further damage to the ECM (Ewald, 2020) by causing unrestrained protease activity and collagen deposition (Fisher et al., 2009). Thus, AGE accumulations and their crosslinks modify the mechanical properties of the ECM with the procession of time and increase the risk of many diseases caused by oxidative stress and inflammation: diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney failures, premature aging, Alzheimer's, and fibrosis (Ahmed, 2005; Gautieri et al., 2016; Glenn and Stitt, 2009; Perty\u0144ska-Marczewska et al., 2009; Semba et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2010). \n",

Proteolysis is also critical in ECM structure reassembly, tissue repair, pathological processes, morphogenesis, and cell death (Solomonov et al., 2016; Werb, 1997). Hence, any changes made by proteolysis to the cell surface and ECM can have an immediate and irrevocable impact (Solomonov et al., 2016). \n\nMaintaining a homeostatic balance of proteolysis is critical in maintaining healthspan as either overproduction or deficiency can lead to disease progressions. The Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their closely related A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases (ADAMs) possess proteolytic properties and are critical contributing factors in various physiological processes and pathologies such as cancer progression and inflammation (Shimoda, 2019). For example, the key component of wound healing is the degradation of provisional ECM produced by the fibrin clot caused by the wound. Injury is repaired by the keratinocytes migration that produces Urokinase Plasminogen Activators (uPAs) and MMPs to close the wound through its interaction with dermal fibroblast. Mice lacking the plasminogen gene, keratinocytes are unable to migrate, and the wound is not healing, indicating the importance of proteolysis homeostasis (Bugge et al., 1996).\n\nAdditionally, Kuzuya et al. demonstrated loss of proteolysis is a consequence of the accumulation of crosslinks in the collagen, which is a common feature of aging by showing smooth muscle cells grown on collagen fibrils activated pro-MMP-2 and was accompanied by increased expression of MT1-MMP and suppressed production of TIMP-2. However, when the smooth muscle cells were grown on glycated collagen fibrils, MMP-2 activation was inhibited, and expression of MT1-MMP was reduced without affecting TIMP-2 production. This suggests that the suppression of MT1-MMP expression may be involved in inhibiting MMP-2 activation on glycated collagen fibrils. The inclusion of aminoguanidine, a cross-linking inhibitor, during collagen glycation restored MMP-2 activation, indicates that cross-links may play a role in the inhibition of MMP-2 activation (Kuzuya et al., 2001). Crosslinking reduces the flexibility and elasticity of collagen, making it more resistant to proteolytic degradation (Bourne et al., 2014; DeGroot et al., 2001; Kuzuya et al., 2001), leading to the accumulation of senescent ECM, which can impair tissue function and contribute to age-related diseases (Bourne et al., 2014; DeGroot et al., 2001). And Col1a1r/r mice, with their type I collagen resistance to collagenase cleavage, exhibited accelerated aging, a host of age-related pathologies, and a dramatic acceleration of senescent cell accumulation (Vafaie et al., 2014). Furthermore, Mmp24-deficient mice exhibit reduced levels of A\u03b2 and APP and decreased glial reactivity and IL-1\u03b2 levels, the pivotal function of MT5-MMP (MMP-24) in Alzheimer's disease progression, as evidenced by its capacity to cleave APP and regulate neuronal activity in the hippocampus (Freitas-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2017; Willem et al., 2015)\u2013highlighting the crucial role of proteolysis in regulating various age-related pathologies (Baranger et al., 2016; Freitas-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2017). Therefore, maintaining a balance of proteolysis is crucial for maintaining the healthspan of tissues and preventing age-related diseases.\n",

To use Herovici staining as a biomarker of aging, tissue samples can be obtained from a range of ages and processed for histological staining using the Herovici method. The stained samples can then be examined under a microscope, and the changes in the ECM can be quantified and compared between different ages (Badylak, 2002). This can provide a measure of the changes in the ECM that occur with aging, and it can be used as an indicator of the age-related changes in the ECM.

This allows researchers to systematically analyze the ECM proteome and understand the specific proteins that are present and their relative abundance (Byron et al., 2013; Naba et al., 2012). Examples of different approaches to tackle these problems are described below:\n\nNaba et al. used a combination of computational and experimental techniques to define and characterize the ECM proteome in normal and tumor tissues. They used in-silico (computational) methods to identify and predict the ECM proteome and then validated their predictions using in-vivo (experimental) techniques, such as mass spectrometry. The authors found that the ECM proteome is highly dynamic and can vary significantly between different tissues and under different physiological conditions. They also identified several ECM proteins that are differentially expressed in normal and tumor tissues and identified several ECM proteins that may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the ECM in normal and pathological processes and the potential for ECM-targeted therapies to improve human health (Naba et al., 2012).\n\nSWATH (Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion mass spectrometry) is a mass spectrometry-based technique that may be used for the quantitative profiling of the matrisome (Collins et al., 2017; Gillet et al., 2012). In SWATH mass spectrometry, samples are first digested into peptides using proteases, and the resulting peptides are then analyzed by mass spectrometry. During the analysis, the mass spectrometer sequentially scans through a range of m/z (mass-to-charge) values, acquiring fragment ion spectra for each m/z value. This allows the acquisition of data from a wide range of peptides in a single experiment (Krasny et al., 2018). One of the key advantages of SWATH mass spectrometry is its ability to provide highly sensitive and reproducible quantitation of large numbers of proteins, making it an ideal tool for the quantitative profiling of the matreotype (Krasny et al., 2018). Additionally, the technique does not require the use of stable isotope-labeled standards, which can be expensive and time-consuming to produce (Krasny et al., 2018; Tabata et al., 2007). Overall, SWATH mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the quantitation of the matrisome and can provide valuable insights into the composition and function of the ECM in normal and pathological conditions (Krasny et al., 2018). OpenSWATH is a highly advanced analytical pipeline designed to unravel the complex interplay between the liver proteome, molecular variations, and metabolic traits. By harnessing the power of mass spectrometry, this pipeline generated an extensive inventory of quantified proteomic data from 662 mice to determine the connections between diet, aging, and gene expression. A major signature of aging was the matrisome (Williams et al., 2022).\n\nHiebert et al. investigated that the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway leads to the reprogramming of fibroblasts and the induction of cellular senescence. They also found that this process is mediated by the targeted modification of the matreotype, specifically through the downregulation of ECM proteins such as collagens and the upregulation of ECM-degrading enzymes such as MMPs (Hiebert et al., 2018). Their study demonstrated the potential for targeting matrisome as a therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with fibroblast dysfunction (Hiebert et al., 2018).\n\nTissue engineering is a field of medicine that seeks to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissues using a variety of approaches, including the use of scaffolds to support the growth of new cells (Caddeo et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2015). Scaffolds are three-dimensional structures that provide physical support for cells to grow and differentiate (Caddeo et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2015). Hill et al. quantified the levels of ECM proteins in a rat lung scaffold and used this information to provide a molecular readout for tissue engineering by using mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of ECM proteins. They found that the scaffold contained a variety of ECM proteins, including collagens, laminins, and proteoglycans. They also found that the levels of these proteins varied depending on the stage of scaffold development\u2013suggesting that the quantification of ECM proteins may be useful as a molecular readout for tissue engineering applications (Hill et al., 2015).\n\nLi et al. used a combination of spatial quantitative proteomics, decellularization, laser capture microdissection, and mass spectrometry to construct a hierarchical map of the proteome in human skin tissue. They analyzed the specific functions of different structures of normal skin tissue and tissue with dermatologic disease. They then identified the ECM glycoprotein transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2)-induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI) in the basement membrane (BM), a thin layer at the top of the dermis, which plays a role in the growth and function of epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) and promotes wound healing. These findings provide insights into the way in which ECM proteins contribute to the function of EpSCs in the BM and may have potential clinical applications in the treatment of skin ulcers or diseases with refractory lesions that involve epidermal cell dysfunction and impaired re-epithelialization (Li et al., 2022).\n\nECM-enriched proteomics is a powerful tool for studying the ECM and its role in various biological processes, including tissue development, maintenance, and repair (Byron et al., 2013; Lindsey et al., 2012; Naba et al., 2012). It is also useful for studying the ECM in the context of diseases, as the ECM is often altered in the context of various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Arteel and Naba, 2020; Iozzo and Gubbiotti, 2018; Naba et al., 2012; Sonbol, 2018). Understanding these changes may provide insights into the underlying pathological mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets.\n",

Alterations in the ECM composition can provide insight into the disease state, which may be utilized as a diagnostic tool for various pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis. \n\nImaging probes GFPtpz and mCherry-tagged collagen fusion constructs were developed by Lu and his team for the live imaging of type I collagen assembly by replacing the \u03b12(I)-procollagen N-terminal propeptide with GFPtpz or mCherry. These imaging probes were transfected into cells and were used to examine the dynamics of type I collagen assembly and its relationship to fibronectin. The fusion proteins were found to co-precipitate with \u03b11(I)-collagen, remaining intracellular without ascorbate but forming \u03b11(I) collagen-containing extracellular fibrils in the presence of ascorbate. The study demonstrates the utility of these imaging probes in providing new insights into the mechanisms of extracellular collagen assembly and its dependence on cell motion and fibronectin assembly\u2013a critical step in understanding the complexities of ECM formation (Lu et al., 2018).\n\nFischer et al. employed a multifaceted approach to investigate the intricacies of the wound-healing process in internal organs. The ECM was labeled in different organs, specifically the mouse peritoneum, liver, and cecum, to reveal the transfer of preexisting matrix across organs in various injury models. The tissue of origin for the transferred matrix was found to dictate the outcome of the healing process, whether it resulted in scarring or regeneration. The transfer of matrix was found to be mediated by neutrophils, in a manner dependent on the HSF-integrin AM/B2-kindlin3 cascade, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of this cascade could prevent the formation of peritoneal adhesions. These may provide a therapeutic window to mitigate scarring across a range of conditions, highlighting ECM labeling as a potential diagnostic tool in wound healing and regenerative medicine (Fischer et al., 2022).\n",

These advancements have led to the proliferation of statistical and machine learning models, which have been employed to track age-related changes at the omic and phenotypic level (Consortium et al., 2021; Galkin et al., 2020; Lazarus et al., 2019; Newman et al., 2016; Rutledge et al., 2022; Schultz et al., 2020).\n\nOne key application of these models is the use of the so-called \"Aging Clock\" to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at extending lifespan, rather than waiting for the entire lifetime of study subjects (X. He et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2022). Additionally, the availability of online services for DNA methylation analysis, such as DNA methylation age and the epigenetic clock (Horvath, 2013b) and SudoClock (\u201cSudoClock,\u201d n.d.), has further facilitated the use of aging clocks in research. Furthermore, consumer services have also started to offer age predictions based on these aging clocks.\n\nHowever, despite these advances, there currently exists no \"Aging Clock\" that directly tracks changes within the ECM. This is particularly noteworthy given that a recent causal investigation of DNA methylation clocks has revealed changes in the ECM to be a major contributor to age-related adaptations (Ying et al., 2022). To evaluate interventions targeting the ECM, researchers must instead rely on individually tailored markers (Zaseck et al., 2016) or surrogate markers, such as differential expression of collagen genes (Chondronasiou et al., 2022) or methylomics of ECM organization promoters (Gill et al., 2022).\n\nRecent efforts have been made to index ECM aging, including the use of modern computational methods. For example, Lehallier et al. used levels of ECM-associated proteins in blood plasma to predict age with relative accuracy (Lehallier et al., 2020). McCabe et al. compiled changes in skin ECM composition during aging and photoaging using quantitative and global proteomics, single harmonic generation, and two-photon autofluorescence imaging (McCabe et al., 2020). Li et al. used tandem mass spectrometry alongside bioinformatic analysis to produce skin proteome profiles and matrisome features at different ages (Li et al., 2021).\n\nGiven the unique influences of ECM aging on important medical practices, such as transplantation (Acun et al., 2021), the development of a standardized ECM aging clock would have a profound impact on medicine. However, until such a model is developed, numerous interesting scientific questions remain unanswered, including which features of the ECM would be most represented, whether they would be tissue-specific, and how closely they would correlate, precede, or follow other clock changes. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether these features could be slowed or reversed.\n",

A tail tendon of a rodent, such as a mouse or a rat, consists mainly of collagen and is isolated and attached to a weight, and then emersed in a urea water bath. The time it takes for the tendon to rupture due to the attached weight correlates with the crosslinking of the collagen in the tendon, which increases with age  (Haefke and Ewald, 2020).\n\nTTBT has been used to study a wide range of conditions that affect tendon health, including aging, diabetes, and various forms of arthritis.

However, it is important to note that the results of the assay may not directly translate to humans, as the anatomy and physiology of tendons in rodents are not exactly the same as in humans.

In particular, N-glycosylation, covalently attaches N-glycans to proteins at asparagine (Asn) residues (Stanley et al., 2022). N-glycan levels in the blood can be measured using techniques such as mass spectrometry or lectin-based assays, and changes in these levels over time may provide insight into the aging process and the risk of age-related diseases (Miura and Endo, 2016; Mkhikian et al., 2022; Zaytseva et al., 2022). Zaytseva et al. observed the relationship between changes in the N-glycosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and 12 different diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular diseases, and some types of cancer, by utilizing Mendelian randomization to examine the causal relationship between IgG N-glycosylation and disease risks. It was found that there is indeed a positive causal effect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on the abundance of certain N-glycans in the total IgG N-glycome. These findings suggest this particular IgG glycosylation trait could potentially be used as a biomarker for SLE (Zaytseva et al., 2022).\n\nAging is also associated with impaired T-cell immunity, which can increase the risk of mortality from infectious diseases such as influenza, Salmonella, and COVID-19 (Mkhikian et al., 2022). Studies have shown that the branching of asparagine-linked glycans increases with age in females more than males, in naive T cells more than memory T cells, and CD4+ T cells more than CD8+ T cells. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) signaling increased in old female mice and triggered increased branching, which was also increased by the rate-limiting metabolite N-acetylglucosamine. Reversing elevated branching can rejuvenate T cell function and reduce the severity of Salmonella infection in old female mice. These findings suggest that IL-7 initially benefits immunity through naive T cells maintenance but inhibits naive T cells function through increased branching in combination with age-dependent increases in N-acetylglucosamine (Deri\u0161 et al., 2022; Mkhikian et al., 2022). These studies and others highlight the importance of understanding the role of glycosylation in aging and age-related diseases, as well as the potential for using N-glycosylation as a biomarker and developing interventions to improve T-cell immunity in aging individuals.\n",

Autofluorescence can be used as a biomarker for various cellular processes, including aging, and it can be measured using fluorescence microscopy or spectroscopy (Kolenc and Quinn, 2019).\n\nOne possible method to use autofluorescence as an ECM aging clock is to measure the autofluorescence of ECM molecules, such as collagen and elastin.

As cells and tissues age, the ECM undergoes changes in its composition and structure, which can affect its mechanical properties and functions (Croce and Bottiroli, 2014; McCabe et al., 2020). For example, aging can cause the ECM to stiffen, which can impair mechanotransduction and lead to stem cell exhaustion (Boers et al., 2018). The C. elegans cuticle, which is mainly composed of collagens, becomes autofluorescent and stiffens with aging, and longevity interventions are able to slow or prevent this age-related stiffening of the ECM in vivo (Davis et al., 1982; Rahimi et al., 2021; Teuscher et al., 2022). \n\nTo measure the autofluorescence of ECM molecules as an aging clock, tissue samples can be obtained from a range of ages and processed for fluorescence microscopy or spectroscopy.

The Sircol Collagen Assay (SCA) is based on the amino acid binding characteristic of Sirius Red (SR F3B; CI 35782), an anionic dye having sulfonated acid side-chain groups that react with the side-chain groups of basic amino acids (Constantine and Mowry, 1968; Sweat et al., 1964) and is frequently employed as a selective histochemical stain for collagen in normal and diseased tissue (Borges et al., 2007; Brotchie et al., 1999; Kratky et al., 1996). The SCA has almost exclusively been adopted as the quickest and most straightforward colorimetric method for determining collagen concentration in complex protein solutions (Lareu et al., 2010; Tarnutzer et al., 2022). \nDespite its prevalence, the SCA also dramatically overestimated collagen content by a factor anywhere from 3 to 24 folds\u2014particularly grievous results arising in cell culture systems and tissue hydrates due to non-collagenous protein interference (Junqueira et al., 1979; Lareu et al., 2010). However, a purification technique including a pepsin digestion and column ultrafiltration step to accurately determine collagen content in various samples that eliminate these interfering proteins has been added to the current SCA approach to resolve this problem (Lareu et al., 2010). The modified Sircol Collagen Assay can therefore offer insight into the aging process and the efficacy of therapies through an accurate evaluation of collagen levels.\n",

It works by using a red acidic stain to label acidophilic components such as collagen fibers and then treating the tissue with Phosphotungstic Acid. The less permeable components, including collagen fibers, will retain the red stain, while the more permeable components will lose the red stain and be replaced with a light green dye (Bancroft and Layton, 2019; Leonard et al., 2018). The distinctive ability of this technique to differentiate collagen fibers has been widely utilized in numerous studies to investigate changes in collagen fibers that occur during development, aging, and disease\u2013pathologies such as muscular dystrophy, infarct, cirrhosis, and glomerular fibrosis (Farris and Alpers, 2014; Gutpell et al., 2015; Krishna, 2013; Onoda et al., 2022). \n",

This process is efficient at high light intensities, such as those produced by a pulsed laser, and is selective with respect to the focal plane in a manner analogous to two-photon fluorescence excitation (Cox and Kable, 2006). Collagen, a highly organized and crystalline structural protein that is abundant in mammals, is the most potent source of SHG in animal tissue (Cox and Kable, 2006; Leonard et al., 2018; Van Gulick et al., 2019). Therefore, SHG imaging can be utilized as a powerful tool for visualizing collagen distribution in various biological samples, including cirrhotic liver, normal and carious teeth, and surgically repaired tendons (Cox and Kable, 2006). One notable advantage of SHG imaging is that it does not result in any energy loss, leading to the long-term stability of the generated SHG signal. Additionally, the shorter wavelength of the SHG signal allows for easy separation from multiple fluorescent probes, making it a valuable technique for multichannel imaging applications (Cox and Kable, 2006; Leonard et al., 2018).\n\nVan Gulick et al. used polarized Raman spectroscopy and SHG to examine age-related changes in the molecular organization of type I collagen in rat tail tendons (Van Gulick et al., 2019). The results showed that certain bands related to proline and hydroxyproline were sensitive to polarization and age-related changes, while others were not. The anisotropy degree of the Raman bands increased from adult to old collagen, indicating a higher alignment of collagen fibers with the fascicle backbone axis in old tendons and a higher straightness of collagen fibers (Van Gulick et al., 2019). These findings were confirmed using SHG, which showed a more homogeneous spatial distribution of collagen fiber alignment in old tendons (Van Gulick et al., 2019). These results demonstrate the usefulness of SHG in studying age-related changes in collagen structure and the impact of these changes on the mechanical and physiological properties of organs (Van Gulick et al., 2019).",

De-novo collagen synthesis is important for tissue development and repair, and it is regulated by various signaling pathways and transcription factors (Last et al., 1989; Last and Reiser, 1989; Laurent, 1982; McAnulty and Laurent, 1987; Onursal et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2007). \n\nSILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) is a mass spectrometry-based technique that uses labeled amino acids to distinguish newly synthesized proteins from pre-existing ones, providing insights into protein synthesis, turnover, and degradation processes (Rosmark et al., 2018). The in-vivo pulsed SILAC labeling methodology was used to quantify new protein incorporation into various tissues in mice (Ariosa-Morejon et al., 2021) and C. elegans (Dhondt et al., 2016; Teuscher et al., 2022; Vukoti et al., 2015), uncovering age-related molecular changes and identifying potential pathways implicated in disease. This approach provides dynamic protein data at a tissue level, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation of protein synthesis (Rosmark et al., 2018).\n\nDendra is a photoconvertible fluorescent protein that enables visualization of de-novo synthesized collagen in living cells by being incorporated as a tag in collagen molecules, fluorescing when newly synthesized and permitting real-time tracking of collagen fiber formation and distribution (Gurskaya et al., 2006; Ihara et al., 2011). A study in C. elegans revealed a thickening of the basement membrane via the addition of newly synthesized EMB-9 collagen to old collagens, offering insight into collagen synthesis mechanisms and the role it plays in various biological processes (Teuscher et al., 2022).\n\nAlso, Oostendorp et al. developed a novel method for detecting and localizing newly synthesized collagen in ECM tissues by employing the use of an antibody called GD3A12, which specifically binds to dermatan sulfate, a component of proteoglycans that are associated with collagen (Oostendorp et al., 2016; Trowbridge et al., 2002). Critically, this method is universal\u2013meaning it can be utilized to detect collagen produced by cells from any species and can be applied to any source of collagenous biomaterials (Oostendorp et al., 2016). It is designed to address the challenge of identifying collagen that has been produced de novo by cells in the presence of purified collagenous biomaterials, which is a common obstacle in the evaluation of tissue-engineered constructs and in the study of tumor dissemination (Gilkes et al., 2014; Oostendorp et al., 2016). The method has potential applications in regenerative medicine and cancer biology, including the investigation of tumor cell migration in collagen gels (Oostendorp et al., 2016). It is worth noting that dermatan sulfate may be associated with other structures, such as elastin and fibrillin-containing microfibrils, but it does not seem to be associated with elastic fibers in the tissues studied (Oostendorp et al., 2016; Zimmermann et al., 1994). Utilization of this method can potentially be an efficient, cost-effective, and straightforward technique for evaluating the presence and orientation of de-novo synthesized collagen fibrils in collagen-based biomaterials (Oostendorp et al., 2016).\n\nAbnormalities in collagen synthesis and metabolism can lead to various diseases and conditions, such as fibrosis, scarring, and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms and regulation of de-novo collagen synthesis is an active and exciting area of research in many fields, including developmental biology, tissue engineering, and medicine.\n",

The DDRs have a preference for damaged or degraded collagens and can stimulate the production and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are enzymes that degrade ECM components (Olaso et al., 2002; Reel et al., 2015). \n\nDysregulation of the DDRs has been linked to various human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, fibrosis, and inflammatory conditions (Borza and Pozzi, 2014; Hebron et al., 2017). For example, over-expression of DDR1 and DDR2 has been observed in multiple forms of cancer, suggesting that they play a role in the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. Collagen, a major component of the ECM, undergoes extensive remodeling during tumor progression, and DDRs may contribute to this process by modulating MMP activity (Ford et al., 2007; Valiathan et al., 2012). Furthermore, Hebron et al. observed increased expression of DDRs in the brains of individuals who have passed away from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Lentiviral shRNA was utilized to specifically reduce the expression of DDR1 and DDR2, which lead to decreased levels of \u03b1-synuclein, tau, and \u03b2-amyloid, and protected against cell death in both in-vivo and in-vitro settings. Additionally, inhibiting DDR1 and DDR2 appeared to modulate the immune response in the brain and reduce levels of TREM-2 and microglia. Based on these findings, targeting DDR1 and DDR2 may provide a novel strategy to clear neurotoxic proteins and reduce inflammation in neurodegenerative conditions (Hebron et al., 2017). Furthermore, machine learning and subsequent in-vitro assays identified DDR1 as a drug target for ameliorating fibrosis (Zhavoronkov et al., 2019). \n\nTherefore, DDRs play a critical role in the aging process and are involved in the development of many age-related diseases, although the precise mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using mouse models with DDRs deletion has allowed us to gain more insights into their role in the progression of diseases. As a result, therapies that target DDRs, such as RNAi-based delivery, are being developed to treat diseases with limited treatment options (Leitinger, 2014).\n",

Integrins are transmembrane proteins that bind to ECM proteins, transmitting signals across the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton and regulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. In addition, they can bind to intracellular signaling proteins, modulating signaling pathways (Adorno-Cruz and Liu, 2018; Albelda and Buck, 1990; Barczyk et al., 2010; Hynes, 2002; Park et al., 2020).\n\nThe functional importance of integrins is highlighted by their involvement in a wide range of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease (Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010; Park et al., 2020). Dysregulation of integrin expression and function has been linked to aging-related disorders such as osteoporosis, arthritis, and fibrosis (Lowin and Straub, 2011; Schnittert et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2005). For instance, decreased expression of the \u03b1-ii subunit of integrin has been linked to age-related bone loss (Stange et al., 2013), while increased expression of the \u03b1-v subunit has been associated with age-related fibrosis in the lung (Henderson et al., 2013). Furthermore, the \u03b1-v subunit has been shown to be upregulated in senescent cells, and targeting this subunit has been demonstrated to improve age-related phenotypes in mice (Borghesan and O\u2019Loghlen, 2017; Schaffner et al., 2013; van der Flier et al., 2010). \n\nThus, integrins are critical transmembrane proteins that mediate various cell functions through their interactions with ECM proteins and intracellular signaling proteins.

The tenascins are subdivided into several different classes, including tenascin-C, tenascin-R, and tenascin-X (Chiquet-Ehrismann and Chiquet, 2003).\n\nTenascin-C is found in the ECM of tissues and plays a role in the organization and development of cells and tissues (Midwood and Orend, 2009). In cancer, Tenascin-C has been shown to play a role in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells, yet the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. It has also been found to promote angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels form, which is essential for tumor growth (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016; Giblin and Midwood, 2014; Lowy and Oskarsson, 2015; Midwood and Orend, 2009; Yoshida et al., 2015). In some cases, increased levels of Tenascin-C have been associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients (Nong et al., 2015). Tenascin-R and tenascin-X, on the other hand, are found in the central nervous system and are involved in the development and function of the brain and nervous system (Jang et al., 2020). \n\nBoth tenascin-C and tenascin-X have been shown to play a role in the biological aging process (Choi et al., 2020; Kasprzycka et al., 2015; Tucker and Degen, 2022). For instance, Mi et al. discovered that tenascin-C immunoreactivity manifested as substantial extracellular deposits of a diffuse nature within the cortical grey matter, possessing diameters exceeding 100 \u00b5m (Mi et al., 2016). These tenascin-C plaques exhibited a complete overlap and encirclement of cored A\u03b2 plaques (Mi et al., 2016). The tenascin-C plaques were also found to be in close proximity to reactive astrocytes, microglia, and dystrophic neurites comprised of phosphorylated tau, suggesting a key role for tenascin-C in the pathogenesis of A\u03b2 plaques and highlight its potential as a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target (Mi et al., 2016). Meanwhile, subjects with low levels of tenascin-X may be protected from the typical onset of abnormal arterial stiffness associated with aging and its associated impact of an anomalously swift round-trip travel time of the pressure wave (Petersen and Douglas, 2013). Notably, Uiterwall et al. established that augmented joint motility and skin resilience correspond with a reduction in blood pressure and pulse pressure levels (Uiterwaal et al., 2003). As such, the absence of tenascin-X results in a perturbation of the standard ECM within the blood vessel walls. And subjects with tenascin-X insufficiency may be susceptible to a greater expansion of the internal elastic lamina, enabling larger atherosclerotic plaques to accumulate and ultimately lead to a reduction in the coronary lumen area (Petersen and Douglas, 2013).",
